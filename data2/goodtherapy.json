    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Deal with Loneliness?",
    "Question": "My life is a sad state of affairs. I have no real friends to speak of, just my cat Lula. Even she doesn’t like me very much. I can’t work because of a disability. I basically sit at home all day eating myself a little closer to irreversible depression and eventual death. This is no way to live, but it’s all I’ve got. I used to rationalize that being alone was okay because I’m an introvert, but that’s dumb. Introverts need love and socializing too. I have nothing! I feel so lonely. I don’t think it’s realistic to expect me to go out and make a bunch of friends. I’m ugly, not very interesting, and I’m not easy to get close to. I don’t let people in. Not sure why, I just never have. So then the question becomes, how do I accept my life for what it is? Is it as simple as no longer judging it as meaningless and empty? Please help me stop feeling so alone.",
    "TherapistReply": "I hear your very real sadness coming through. Thank you for reaching out. I am actually hearing two different questions in your message—how do I accept my life as it is, and how do I change it to be less lonely?\n\nI recommend you start by finding a therapist in your area. I hear a lot of negative self-talk and negative self-concept in your message. Finding a way to appreciate what you have to offer yourself and the world around you will be an important first step. Your comment about not letting people in—and that you never have—lets me know the work really begins there in understanding what about connecting with others is scary for you. You also mention not wanting to judge your life as “meaningless and empty.” I agree this is an important goal! Feeling a sense of purpose is essential to long-term well-being. That purpose can be localized or it can be on a broader scale, but feeling that we matter, that we have an impact, that we have a reason for being here is important. You are not alone in struggling to find purpose. Again, working with someone to explore what is meaningful to you will be important.\n\nYou are right: introverts need connection too. It is up to you, though, what connection looks like. I have known people who had many friends and were very social and still felt extremely lonely. Meaningful connection with self, with others, and with the world around us can help reduce feelings of loneliness. I encourage you to start that journey by finding someone who can help you work on a meaningful connection to yourself, one in which you feel more accepting of who you are. From there, you can explore how to connect with others."

    "QuestionTitle": "What’s the Best Way to Break Up?",
    "Question": "I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now and I don’t see a future together. It was fun for a while, but now it feels stale and unexciting. I don’t love him and never have. I’m bored, he mostly annoys me now, and I don’t want to be in the relationship anymore. My friends have been telling me to end it for months, but I don’t know how. I suck at breaking up with guys. I usually end up waiting until they get so frustrated with me that they decide to end it, and then I feel relieved that I didn’t have to. I know that probably makes me a terrible person, but I don’t like hurting people’s feelings, so it’s hard for me to be honest and direct like that. Unfortunately, my boyfriend doesn’t seem at all deterred by the distance I have been putting between us. I don’t see him ending this. I’m going to have to buck up somehow and do it. But how? A couple of my friends have broken up with guys by text or app. One said leave a written note. One said call him and call it good. My parents say I should meet him in a public place and deliver the news in person, but I am worried he’ll react badly and make a scene. What do you think? Is there a “right way” to break up (and is there a “wrong way”)?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing in with such a great question. First, I’d like to assure you that none of what you described makes you a terrible person. Many people do not like to invite potential for conflict, to deliver bad news, or to hurt other people’s feelings. Breaking up with a partner raises all of these possibilities. It is hard to do, and most people don’t enjoy doing it; in fact, a lot of people avoid it. It sounds like avoidance has been your approach—you create distance and wait for your partner to get frustrated and end it themselves. One of the problems with trying to behave in a way that causes your partner to end the relationship is that it can lead to what you are dealing with now. You want out of the relationship and are behaving as such, but your boyfriend is either not getting it or doesn’t mind the behavior. Either way, he’s not ending it and you are stuck. Trying to force a certain behavior—in this case, a breakup—from someone else can be quite frustrating for both people. You’re wondering why he isn’t breaking up with you and growing more and more annoyed by his presence, and he might well be feeling hurt or frustrated wondering what is happening.\n\nWhen this kind of issue shows up in my practice, I often find it is emblematic of a general discomfort with asking for what one wants and needs. I wonder if, in your relationships, you have a hard time asking for what you want or need—maybe you find yourself dropping hints in the hopes your partner will pick up on them and act. If this rings true for you, perhaps you can think of your pending breakup as an opportunity to state your desire: in this case, the desire to end the relationship. Learning how to ask for what you need is essential to having happy and healthy relationships. Even if you want out of this one, you can think of it as practice for your next relationship.\n\nIt is not easy to learn how to be direct and open with your needs and desires; sometimes there are underlying challenges such as self-worth issues or unhealthy models in your family of origin. You might even find it helpful to partner with a therapist to explore some of this and practice new behaviors.\n\nAs for your question about whether there a “right way” or a “wrong way” to break up, I think the modality you use is less important than deciding you are going to assert your desire to end the relationship. You want out of it, and you have wanted out of it for some time. You deserve to stand up and state that and get what you want for yourself, rather than waiting and hoping someone else will give it to you."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Therapist Ended Her Practice \nand I Don’t Know What to Do",
    "Question": "I had been seeing my therapist for 28 years. Around March, she was unwell. This was a rare occurrence in our time together. But her viral infection persisted until about six weeks ago, when she texted me to say she would not be returning to her practice. I was and am devastated.\n\nI asked if it would it be okay to email her. She said yes, but when I did, she said she was still ill. Initially, I drew on our relationship, which I had come to internalize. However, as the weeks have passed, I have felt angry at the way it ended. And as a recovering alcoholic (dry for 10 years), I am fearful of the future. I would value your views.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for asking this question, and I imagine other readers thank you as well. Few things can be more painful than the sudden end of a relationship, particularly one in which we felt a strong connection and entrusted with our vulnerabilities. I can hear the loss and confusion you feel and what I presume is a sense of abandonment. These are huge, potentially overwhelming emotions. Congratulations for reaching out for help.\n\nWhen therapy ends prematurely, especially when it is characterized by a deeply established relationship, it can feel like your world is being turned upside down. It is not uncommon to feel the way you feel. I imagine it is hard to understand what led your therapist to terminate her practice so abruptly and taper off communication. It is understandable to take this as a personal loss. In an ideal scenario, when a therapist plans to retire or end their practice, they communicate this plan with clients well in advance and they discuss and process the transition in session, perhaps even over time. Unfortunately, sometimes illness and/or other circumstances beyond a therapist’s control may necessitate a less-than-ideal end to the therapeutic relationship. In this case, it is up to clients to pick up the pieces and move forward, perhaps with the help of another therapist. (It is worth noting, though clearly not what is happening in your case, that when a client leaves therapy prematurely or without closure, this presents another challenge for recovery.)\n\nYou mentioned that you recognize how you have internalized this relationship. No doubt you have drawn many associations between the role of your therapist in your recovery and progress. It is clear from what you wrote that your therapist has been instrumental in your healing process. I would like to point out something else: YOU have made it through the challenges you have encountered during the time you worked with your therapist. YOU have maintained your sobriety for the past decade. Your therapist was likely not with you during every one of your darkest moments, but YOU were. While you may have internalized the voice of your therapist when experiencing these dark moments, ultimately YOU have managed these circumstances. You made the decisions yourself."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Have No One to Talk To",
    "Question": "Ever since my dad died last year, I have had no one to talk to. And really, I had no one to talk to for the last three years of his life, ravaged as he was by Alzheimer’s. I don’t have any other family. I have no close friends, no husband or boyfriend, and no children. It’s just me and my constant companions: emptiness, loneliness, and my 8-year-old dog Roxie. When she goes, my life will truly be meaningless. Sometimes I hope she outlives me. If God had told me this would be my life, I would have stayed put. I’m not kidding when I say I can go three or four days without saying a word to anyone. I write, but it’s just for me (except this letter). Writing is like talking to myself, so that’s something, I guess. And it keeps me from losing track of language altogether. Sometimes I feel like I’m starting to lose my mind the way Dad did. So now that you know how pathetic my life is, go ahead and tell me there is “hope” if only I do this, that, and the other thing. I probably won’t believe you, but I wouldn’t be writing if I had given up completely.",
    "TherapistReply": "Your letter inspires my curiosity, not my advice. I’m not going to tell you to do anything because I believe you already know what to do—you’re just not ready. Perhaps you’re too mad or too sad. Both, maybe? What I will say is caring for your dad for three years took a lot out of you. You’re flattened, your energy seemingly used up.\n\nIt’s time for renewal. I think that’s why you wrote this letter. I don’t know what you do to care for yourself. I don’t know what you like to do, what you’d like to learn to do, or what you’d like to do differently, but you probably know the answers. Knowing what to do can be a lot easier than doing it, of course.\n\nI’m not sure what you mean when you write, “If God had told me this would be my life, I would have stayed put.” Stayed put where? In a different house, job, city, state, state of existence? There are hints of hopelessness in your words, but there is always hope. Sometimes it helps when someone removed from your situation points it out. Speaking of hope, I hope you will consider working with a therapist for this reason. No good therapist is going to tell you what to do, but they will walk with you through the hardest parts until you see your own way forward.  Had you always lived with your father? Had you always lived the same way? You cared for your dad, Alzheimer’s and all, for three years. You know plenty about commitment and devotion to others. I wonder where and how you learned. Did someone once care for you that way? Can you use your compassion and commitment for yourself, too? If not, why not?\n\nI have a lot of questions. Maybe too many. Do you ever question yourself? You write, so I’m guessing you do.\n\nYou are clearly lonely, but you know how to reach people if you want. You’ve put yourself in solitary confinement. I wonder what you’ve done to deserve this. Or what you think you’ve done.\n\nIs it punishment or choice? Maybe you like having time alone, too. After all, you don’t have to take care of anybody except yourself and your dog.\n\nYou think your life is “pathetic”? I don’t think so. I think you’ve got plenty going for yourself. You just need to decide to use what you have."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Don’t Want to See My Family Anymore",
    "Question": "I’m done with my family. With the exception of my brother-in-law, they have all become angry, nasty people (dare I say racist in many cases). Their beliefs are the polar opposite of mine. Some of them believe and say things that would be very hurtful to some of my friends, and I find it deeply offensive. Of course, they think it’s my problem for being offended. Apparently there is nothing wrong with them and I just need “thicker skin.” You know what? No. If not for our shared DNA, we wouldn’t even be friends. Why should I pretend to like you just because we were put on this earth in circumstances that caused us to have to tolerate each other? I have to tell you how alone I feel right now. I hate that I feel so out of place in my own family. It feels like a choice between morality and loyalty. I choose morality. My brother-in-law tends to grin and bear it, but I can tell he is struggling with this too. I’m not sure why I am writing. I’m just really sad right now. I don’t feel like I have a family, even though they are alive and well. And I don’t know what to do about that.",
    "TherapistReply": "I’m so sorry you find yourself in such a painful place. We are living in polarized times where the differences between us can feel like insurmountable gulfs. There are many people finding themselves at odds with friends, family members, and coworkers in surprising and hurtful ways. There is no one way to manage these hurtful experiences; we can only find the path that works for us.\n\nPeople can disagree, and yet, with compassion and empathy, hear one another and find ways to connect. It sounds, however, as if you have raised your concerns with your family and have been brushed off and had your feelings dismissed. That is not what you might hope to experience from those who are, in theory, closest to you. I hear you framing your dilemma as a conflict between morality and loyalty. Perhaps the issue is better understood as one of mutual respect of one another’s humanity. You have tried to share your feelings and discomfort and have not received understanding, compassion, or respect. It would be understandable if you did not want to continue being in relationship with people who seem to care so little about how you feel. That isn’t disloyalty, that is self-preservation.\n\nGiven how hurt and isolated you feel, it may be helpful to talk with a licensed therapist about your feelings of loss and disappointment. You can explore how you want to move forward and if there may be ways to stay connected with your family that would not be so painful.\n\nEach of us has the family we were born into and the family that we create. Both can be supportive parts of our lives, but sometimes we have to move away from one toward another that serves us better."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Trust a Therapist If I Can’t\n Trust Anyone?",
    "Question": "I grew up in a dysfunctional family. I know every family is a little dysfunctional, but my parents were a special case. They were always trying to catch each other cheating. Back before cell phones were a thing, Dad would sneak down into the basement and listen on our house’s landline. Mom would hide a camera in Dad’s office. It was like a bad spy movie. As an only child, getting caught up in their spy war was inevitable. When I started doing normal teen stuff like sneaking a boy into my room, my parents would magically “know,” even if they were fast asleep at the time. They would parrot back private stuff I said to my friends over the phone, then laugh when I freaked out. After years of gaslighting, I seriously thought I was losing my mind. I know now that my parents were the messed-up ones, not me. But I still have all the habits I learned as a kid. I don’t talk about anything that could be used against me. I have a phone, but I’m leery about using it unless it’s an emergency. I know this kind of paranoia isn’t healthy. I want to change. Coworkers and friends have told me to see a therapist, but telling somebody my darkest secrets sounds like my worst nightmare. The only reason I’m emailing you is because I know this is anonymous (and because I’m using my throwaway email). I know deep down that most therapists would not blackmail me. But when I think about contacting one, I freak out and start thinking, “What if this is a bad one? What if they have hidden cameras in their office?” Trust isn’t a switch I can just turn on. I have barely any faith in my own memory some days, much less in a person I don’t know. Is there a way I can get help without throwing myself into a panic attack?",
    "TherapistReply": "I am so deeply appreciative that you took the risk to write in with this question and share so much of yourself. Even with the anonymity and “throwaway email,” I imagine sharing the details of your life is quite unsettling for you.\n\nHuman beings are remarkably adaptable. When children grow up in unhealthy environments, they typically adapt to those environments by developing various ways of being. These include behaviors, emotional regulation, communication styles, and relational approaches. While these ways of being help children survive the unhealthy environments they’re in, they become problematic outside of said environment. As children move on to adolescence and eventually adulthood, these ways of being either lead them to find other unhealthy environments or they find that in healthier environments, their ways of being create discord.\n\nIt sounds like this is where you find yourself now. You learned not to trust, not to share, and to be cautious about what, where, and how you communicated. The good news is it sounds like you have found some healthier environments; you mention friends and coworkers who care enough about you to suggest getting help. Unfortunately, I imagine you are finding that the ways of being you developed as child are now getting in the way. Therapy is, of course, an excellent forum for dealing with this. But because not trusting and not sharing were central to your adaptation, it is terrifying to think about trusting a therapist enough to share your “darkest secrets.” The question then becomes, how can you engage in the therapeutic process when trust is so difficult? First, I would suggest you look around at local therapists’ profiles and websites. Read a little about them and see if there are some you feel drawn to. Ask some of the friends and coworkers who have suggested therapy to you if they know of any therapists they would feel confident recommending. Once you gather a list of potential therapists, call them and spend a few minutes speaking to each. Then you can schedule appointments with a few you feel comfortable with and from those initial sessions decide who you’d like to work with.\n\nOnce you select a therapist, rather than diving right into the meat of the work, take some time to allow the therapeutic relationship to be established. You raise the question of how you can “get help without throwing (yourself) into a panic attack.” Perhaps you could begin your work by talking about the anxiety you feel about starting therapy and the fears you have about trusting a therapist. Maybe you could even work on learning some techniques to help you manage your anxiety. Give yourself some time to develop a sense of trust in your therapist before you disclose anything that feels too private. Also, as you move through the process, don’t be afraid to continue talking about any feeling you might have around trust between you and your therapist.\n\nFinally, I just want to say that I applaud you for pushing beyond your comfort zone to consider getting help. Understandably, you have some deep-seated trust issues. And while that makes the process of seeking out and engaging in therapy challenging, it will be well worth it if you walk away from the process with a sense of healing and the ability to enrich your life with strong, trusting relationships. You deserve that."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Want to Stop Competing with My Friend",
    "Question": "My best friend and I have known each other since college. We started out as “enemies,” competing to see who could get the best grades, run the fastest mile … you get the idea. Rivalry led to grudging respect, which in turn led to a ride-or-die brotherhood.\n\nWe moved in together after graduation, but the competitive streak never went away. We’ve always been rivals first, friends second. Now that we live together, we have smaller, more personal things to compete over, such as who’s growing the better beard, who makes more money, and so on.\n\nAt first it was a blast. We had dumb contests over who could clean their half of the apartment quickest or who could finish their cereal first. It made all the boring parts of adulthood fun.\n\nBut after three years, the rivalry has become a drain on my life. I feel as if I’m always putting on a show, like I can’t relax in my own apartment. It’s gotten to the point where I’m driving the scenic route home, buying a few more minutes to myself.\n\nPart of me wonders if I lost my enthusiasm because my friend got a promotion at his job before I did. I’m happy for him, really. But now there’s this unspoken tension between us. My line of work requires a lot more training than his does, so I won’t catch up financially in two years at least. I’m finding myself being more competitive about fitness to compensate, even though I’m already exhausted.\n\nI want to quit this never-ending competition, or at least dial it back some. But if I talk to my friend about it, I’ll be “surrendering,” and my pride can’t take that. Is there any way for me to bow out of this rivalry without losing my friend’s respect?",
    "TherapistReply": "It’s funny you ask me that, because your competitor/friend also just wrote to me, and I’m trying to decide which is the better question.\n\nOkay, I’m kidding. I appreciate the question. To be honest, it sounds like an excellent premise for a comedy film or short story. I can see the caption now: “Let the game begin!” with two serious young men staring at us.\n\nI can’t help but wonder what keeps it going, and (in all seriousness) what makes the stakes so important. It is somewhat intriguing you have this self-protective pride with (I’m assuming) such a good friend (let’s call him John for the sake of simplicity). What’s up with that?\n\nIt makes sense that after three years you have tired of the constant rivalry, which from the sound of it pretty much overwhelms the friendship. I’m trying to imagine what meals at home are like. “Pass the salt.” “Quick: What’s the chemical compound of salt, and which elemental combination is toxic?” It’s a sure way to drive one batty, and I commend you for hanging in there so long. Part of me wonders, in fact, if your friend/rival feels the same.\n\nIn fact, it sounds as if the intense, never-ending competition has become a bit toxic, and certainly not fun—which begs the question of why you haven’t discussed it yet.\n\nThe moment I typed that question, a thought came to me. Perhaps it is hard for you to tell if “John” is truly a caring friend—would he forgive or accept your wanting to end the exhausting, perpetual contests, or would he lord it over you and say, “Ah, so you couldn’t handle the pressure, eh bro? Guess I win!” If so, the risk then is of possibly losing the friendship or taking a hit to your self-esteem (since obviously his estimation of you matters to you), thus the dilemma of having to endure or continue a competition longer than any iron man contest imaginable.\n\nNow for a bit of oversimplified psychology. The pioneer psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut, who bravely broke away from Sigmund Freud to create a psychoanalytic or psychological perspective based on empathy, spoke of two types of “transferences.” Transference can be understood in myriad ways.\n\nOne of the ways I think of it is how we attach to others. Specifically, others who represent the possibility of meeting some of our ongoing or unmet emotional needs. It is not unusual for young men to enter the kind of friendly, even sometimes edgy competition you speak of. Here, however, there seems to be an extra something underscoring the contest; something that is very much at stake, that could be lost if one of you “gives in” or “succumbs.”\n\nKohut spoke of an idealizing transference and a twinship transference. (There are other types, and this is oversimplified for the sake of brevity.) An idealizing transference tends to be that of a child looking up to a parent in search of positive reflection, encouragement, self-esteem, what have you. In Star Wars, for instance, Luke has competing father figures: the loving and benevolent Obi-Wan Kenobi and the darker, ego-based Darth Vader, each of whom struggles for the allegiance of Luke’s soul.\n\nIn this vein, I detect a possible co-idealization going on—either between you and “John,” or between you and some internalized father or authority figure whose possible “approval” (or denial thereof) is at stake in these contests, which have taken on significance. It makes me wonder if each of you sees a bit of your own father (or mother, or some other authority figure) in the other, or if you both invoke a coach you both had who instigated competition and doled out approval. Perhaps, along these lines, the two of you are now enacting or reliving an earlier, unresolved competition, the psychological stakes of which are mutually understood to be high.\n\nThis brings me to the second idealization Kohut talks about, which is twinship, or a profound sense of close companionship or cosmic similarity. A twinship is, as the name suggests, analogous to siblings. Using the Skywalker example, Luke turns out to have a profound twinship with his sister Leia, and (SPOILER ALERT!) sacrifices his life for her in the most recent installment. On a more comic level, there is a rich twinship between the two droids, C3PO and R2D2. (Many comic duos are based on such twinships, such as Laurel and Hardy, Hope and Crosby, Cheech and Chong, and man am I dating myself!)\n\nI am curious about whatever deeper or unconscious motivations are pushing this initially rousing (I am guessing) and benevolently competitive twinship into an intensive contest where only one of you “wins” while the other shamefully “loses”—as if some judging but invisible authority figure is hovering close at hand. Finally, allow some compassion for the two of you, certainly yourself. Change is difficult, and transitioning into post-college adulthood is daunting. Clearly you have other tasks before you, and life is calling you forth. Sounds like you have good intuition to move on from this, and I would follow it."

    "QuestionTitle": "Will Social Anxiety Go Away?",
    "Question": "I have really bad social anxiety. I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything anymore because I’m worried I will say something stupid and people won’t like me. I am not a good speaker, so I tend to say things that sound dumb. Then I spend the rest of the night thinking about what other people were thinking when I said it. I second-guess myself a lot. It has gotten to the point that even when I am forced to be around people, I stay quiet most of the time. I overheard someone tell their friend that I am “unfriendly” and “aloof” because I don’t involve myself in conversations. It’s like my choices are (1) sound dumb or (2) seem unfriendly. I can’t make friends because of my social anxiety and I don’t feel like there is anything I can do about it. Does social anxiety get better or go away in time? Or am I stuck being a socially awkward misfit for the rest of my days?",
    "TherapistReply": "The pain and frustration you are feeling comes through loud and clear. You feel like social interactions are no-win situations—you either remain quiet and risk being perceived as unfriendly or try to participate in conversations and risk being perceived as less intelligent than you are. I also imagine this can become somewhat self-perpetuating. As you become more and more self-conscious about your social interactions, it likely becomes harder for you to engage in a way that feels good.\n\nYou pose two questions: one, will your social anxiety diminish in time, and two, are you stuck dealing with social anxiety forever. I suggest tabling those questions in favor of a different question: What can you do to make yourself feel more confident and capable in social situations?Joining a therapy group could be helpful. I know it might sound frightening to willingly put yourself in a group of strangers on a regular basis when doing so is deeply anxiety-provoking, but a therapy group is quite different from a typical social situation. First, it is designed to help group members deal with the issues they face. Second, therapy groups are established with rules that are designed to ensure the safety of group members. A group affords you the safety and security of therapy along with the opportunity to explore social interactions and try on new behaviors. As you do so, inside and outside of the group, you’ll have the support of the group to celebrate your successes and to process the things that don’t go as well as you would have liked.\n\nIf starting out with a therapy group sounds like too much, that is okay. You might feel more comfortable partnering with an individual therapist first to explore your social anxiety and develop a deeper understanding of it. You could also work with a therapist to develop some tools for coping with the anxiety so joining a group doesn’t feel so daunting. You could even begin working on developing some social skills that you could begin practicing when you join the group.\n\nThere are also public speaking groups, such as Toastmasters, that are designed to teach people how to master public speaking. Even people who feel relatively confident in social situations can have tremendous anxiety when it comes to public speaking. Perhaps if you developed a sense of mastery in public speaking, smaller social situations wouldn’t feel so overwhelming.\n\nHowever you choose to handle this, I encourage you to take a proactive approach. There is treatment available to help you learn to navigate social situations in a way that feels more comfortable and allows you to form deeper, more satisfying relationships. You deserve that!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Do I Have to Forgive My Dad for Leaving?",
    "Question": "My dad abandoned our family when I was in elementary school. A week after my birthday, actually. At 8 years old, I was man of the house. My mom was already bringing home all the cash, since my dad never worked. Money-wise, our family’s situation didn’t change. But when my dad left, there was no more babysitter. I had to step up and be the parent for my own brothers, microwaving their dinners, teaching them to tie their shoes, and so on. This was back when kids could still play outside without the neighbors calling child services. At the time, I figured my dad had rejected us. I got a whole inferiority complex about it in my teens. I looked for role models in all the wrong places. Therapy helped me get my act together, but it didn’t make the hurt go away. Later, my mom told me my dad was an alcoholic. He didn’t abandon us for another family. He was just getting drunk in a bar somewhere. Instead of hating myself, I started hating him. I mean, it was bad enough to choose another kid over me, but to leave me for booze? It didn’t make sense. I’ve worked hard to move on. I have my own children now, and I raise them as best I can. But a month ago, guess what happened? The prodigal father returned. He said he’s gotten sober and he wants to be a father again. He wants to meet his grandchildren. My little brothers forgave him instantly. They were toddlers when he left, so his absence didn’t hurt them as much. They pity my dad for having an addiction. Now they’re pressuring me to invite him to my daughter’s baptism. I told my brothers that I refuse to let that man back into my life. If they want to spend time with him, that is their business. But I spent my whole life learning to get along without my dad. I see no reason to restart a relationship that only brought me pain. Do I have to forgive my dad? I feel like I’m chained to this person who almost ruined my life. Am I a bad person if I want to leave my deadbeat dad in the past?",
    "TherapistReply": "You are the only one who can decide what relationship, if any, you want to have with your dad. If you choose not to engage with him, that does not make you a bad person. Simply being related by blood does not require us to sustain a relationship, particularly if that relationship feels hurtful or harmful.\n\nI would encourage you, however, to work on forgiveness. Not for your dad’s sake, or so you can build a relationship with him, but for your sake. Holding on to pain, anger, and resentment winds up being toxic. It casts a shadow over our lives and our relationships in sometimes significant ways.Your father was not able to be there for you when you were growing up. That was painful and confusing. His limitations prevented him from being the dad you wanted or needed. Nothing he does now will change that. You can, however, change your understanding of your experience if you choose to. Your dad’s addiction prevented him from showing up for his family. It must have been a powerful force for him to miss out on so much.\n\nIt might help you to find other grown children of people with alcoholism to share your feelings and experiences with. They may be able to share their stories and their struggles in ways that help you clarify your own. There are usually groups and meetings you can attend to meet others who might have similar stories to tell. I also encourage you to reconnect with a therapist to work through how you want to handle the family pressure you are feeling to invite someone who hurt you back into your life.\n\nIt is possible to have compassion for your father and to recognize his struggles and limitations without choosing to allow him into your life. Whatever you decide, leading with anger or resentment may cause you more pain and regret. If you are able to release yourself from that hurt, you may be more likely to find peace with your choices."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Can’t I Cry?",
    "Question": "My ex-husband is suing me. My kids don’t want anything to do with me. My job is a dead end, and my life sucks. I feel like I have no future and can’t see beyond the end of this letter. So why can’t I cry?\n\nMost people in my situation would be bawling their eyes out, but I feel nothing. Just a void—an empty, numb, emotionless void. I can’t even remember the last time I cried. It has to have been over a decade.\n\nI seem to have no tears in me at all. I even tried to force myself to cry the other day because I thought it might help to finally do it. I hit myself, hurt myself, called myself names. Nothing.\n\nWhat gives? The only thing I can find online is information about melancholia. I might be depressed, but I don’t feel like that’s the whole story. I haven’t been able to cry for a long, long time. Is there a psychological explanation for this? And what can I do about it?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like there is a tremendous amount of turmoil in your life. Considering the far-reaching impact it has had on a previous marriage, your relationships with your children, and your work, I’m guessing it didn’t come to be this way overnight. I imagine things fell apart a little bit here and a little bit there over time. If I’m correct about that, I think it is possible the numbness you describe initially developed as a coping mechanism—a way to help you manage all the pain associated with the tumult in your family and work.Sometimes people try to cut off the more difficult emotions they experience, like grief, sadness, fear, and anxiety. The problem with cutting off painful emotions is that it also cuts off the positive ones, resulting in a sense of numbness. It sounds like somewhere along the way you just shut down to try to protect yourself from pain. After building this defense system over time, it can be difficult to reconnect with your emotions, as you discovered in your attempts to cry.\n\nI think it would be helpful for you to talk with a therapist as you try to work through this and reconnect with your feelings. The safety of a strong therapeutic relationship can allow you to explore your world, past and present, and access your full range of emotions. Your work in therapy can also help you to develop healthier coping mechanisms to handle the more painful emotions you experience. It’s also possible that getting to healthier emotional state might help you to repair some of the relationships that seem so badly damaged. You might also feel better positioned to take on some new career challenges.\n\nYou have arrived a difficult place in your life and there are no quick fixes, but you do not have to go through this alone. There is help."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Cope with Being the Least\n Favorite Child?",
    "Question": "My parents have three children, and I’m the least favorite. They’ve never said it in those exact words, but it’s obvious in the way they act. My two younger sisters are spoiled rotten. They don’t do half the chores I did at their ages. My parents pay for any clothes or gadgets they ask for. One of them is getting a car for her next birthday. Meanwhile, I’m working part time in between college classes just to afford textbooks.\n\nWhenever I bring up the difference in treatment, my parents get really defensive. They argue they were just teenagers when they had me, so they couldn’t afford nice things like they can today. But if they have money now, shouldn’t they split it evenly between their kids? I mean, I know at 19 I’m technically an adult, but all my friends’ parents at least try to pitch in with college expenses. Mine are the only ones who don’t pay anything.\n\nIt’s not just money, either. I visit home every other weekend, but my parents basically ignore me. Whenever we have company over, my parents will brag on and on about my sisters, but I’m always mentioned as an afterthought. I feel like a ghost in my own house.\n\nI feel like I shouldn’t care this much. I’m an adult, so I shouldn’t be chasing after my parents’ approval. But I can’t stop obsessing about it. I’ll literally lie awake at night, just being angry. Sometimes I’ll find myself snapping at my sisters, even though they’re just kids and it’s not their fault for being the favorites.\n\nIs there a way I can get my parents to see how unfair this all is? I sort of want to stop visiting home, just to see how they’d react. Is that petty? Should I just accept that I’m the least favorite kid and move on?",
    "TherapistReply": "Perhaps no relationships are as complicated as family relationships. It’s not unusual for oldest children to feel like they get the short end of the stick while their younger siblings get spoiled.\n\nOften, as the family dynamics change, there are some very real differences in what parents are able to offer their children. If your parents were teenagers when you were born, it is likely you had a starkly different childhood than your siblings. Is it fair? No. Rarely are family dynamics fair. Generally, most parents try to meet the needs of their children that they are able to meet. There may have been needs of yours they were not able to meet that they can meet now for your sisters.\n\nIt seems, though, that bringing these disparities to your parents’ attention is triggering their defenses rather than empathy for you. It could be your observations are heard as a criticism of your childhood rather than as a wish that things could be more equitable now. While there may be many reasons your family dynamics are what they are, none of this diminishes the pain you feel.It may be helpful to think about what you want in terms of a relationship with your parents independent of what your sisters are experiencing. If you would like financial support with schooling, perhaps you could ask for it—not because your sisters have so much more than you did, but because it would be helpful to you. If you keep your sisters and any comparisons to them out of the picture, you might be able to focus on your relationship with your parents and reduce the defensiveness you’ve experienced from them.\n\nYou may also want to work with a licensed professional to explore why their approval is as important to you as it seems to be. There are likely some core messages you are getting from your family experiences that are creating significant distress. Working with a therapist may help you reframe your experiences in a way that brings you peace.\n\nWhatever path you follow, if you focus on how unfair things are, you may only build resentment that creates a barrier between you and all members of your family. If you want to have healthy relationships with your parents and your sisters, finding ways to remove resentment will be essential."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Quit Teaching and \nGive Up on My Dream?",
    "Question": "I can’t do this anymore. I wasn’t expecting to strike it rich as a history professor. Nobody becomes a teacher for the money. But I thought that with a PhD, I could convince somebody to give me a living wage.\n\nI drive around the city teaching at three separate colleges throughout the week. I share a studio apartment with a roommate (also a teacher). At my age, I wasn’t expecting to scrape by on part-time jobs with a rising pile of debt. It’s humiliating.\n\nMy situation would be easier to handle if I knew what I did wrong. But I did everything society said I needed to succeed. I graduated from a top school, did internships, published articles. My student evaluations are better than the tenured teachers’.\n\nI feel like I’ve been cheated. Why did I pay tuition all those years if there were no jobs for my skill set? The sheer unfairness of it all makes me want to give up. I wish I could start my life over.\n\nI know this isn’t healthy. Plenty of people have told me to find a new career. But teaching history has been my dream, ever since I was a little girl. I can’t bear the thought of never being in a classroom again. I feel like if I quit now, I’ll spend the rest of my life with this failure over my head.\n\nPlease help me. I can’t keep following a dead-end career into poverty. But I can’t bring myself to give up on my dream, either. What should I do?",
    "TherapistReply": "As you well know, teachers don’t tend to make a lot of money but do expect satisfaction from their work (which happens to be very hard work). From the description of your routine, I am guessing you work as an adjunct at three different colleges. Compared to other teachers, adjuncts typically make less money, have less job security, and are often dissatisfied with their jobs. I’m sure it’s no fun traveling from one school to another, one part of the city to another. It’s time consuming and no doubt irritating. Often, adjuncts take on other types of employment to make ends meet.\n\nYou are not obligated to give up your dream, although changing some of the details might help. For example, you might consider applying to a college in a different location for a more stable and satisfying, non-adjunct position. Perhaps you already have. Perhaps relocating isn’t an option.That’s pretty much the extent of any employment advice I have to offer. I’m not a career counselor, after all. What I can address is your deep dissatisfaction with your life and your feeling of having been cheated. There is a fair bit of despair in your tone, a perfectly human response to a common plight. You say feel like a failure, and you sound hopeless. Those kinds of feelings can’t help but color your self-confidence, let alone your worldview.\n\nSatisfaction is found within, not from the outside. It might behoove you to look inside and see what else might be eating at you. An inner journey, with a therapist as your guide, might reveal that your life has its satisfactions as well as old, hidden problems that may be affecting how you live.\n\nWould you consider working with a psychotherapist who can help you get to know yourself better? You don’t sound like someone who likes herself very much. You also don’t sound like someone who has a lot of experience identifying your needs or caring for yourself. Therapy can help bring your most cherished values forward so you can live your life with more authenticity and contentment.\n\nIf you’re concerned that therapy costs money, know that many therapists have sliding-scale fees.\n\nIf you wish to start your life over, you can. It starts by learning the many ways a meaningful life can be lived. On your terms.\n\nAs I read your letter, I found myself wondering how old you are. Then I realized your age doesn’t much matter. What does matter are your connections to life, feeling needed, and being an integral part of a whole, an important member of a community. That makes a difference—and it makes a difference whether you’re teaching or pursuing a new path."

    "QuestionTitle": "Does OCD Get Worse Before \nIt Gets Better?",
    "Question": "I have bad OCD. Fear of germs, obsessive and anxious thoughts, needing things to always be perfect and orderly—you name the symptom, I’m pretty sure I have it.\n\nBefore you suggest it, I’m going to contact a therapist. But my question is whether, even with therapy, OCD gets worse before it gets better. Most things I see people dealing with, especially mental health issues, don’t tend to improve as they get older. If anything, their problematic thoughts tend to harden into fully formed habits and they become more difficult to shake. Is that the case with OCD? How quickly can I expect therapy to help? (For that matter, will it help at all? Will it cure me or just give me ways to cope?)\n\nFrom what I’ve read, obsessive-compulsive disorder isn’t the kind of thing you just “get over.” I want to know what kind of journey I need to buckle in for here, and whether the ride is likely to get bumpier before it smoothens out. Please be brutally honest, if need be. Thank you for your time.",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you’re doing the most important thing you can do if you think you have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). You’re investigating what you need to know and looking into seeking help to manage and, ideally, overcome your symptoms. Your instinct to contact a therapist is a good one. If you haven’t already done so, I strongly encourage you to not delay and schedule an appointment.\n\nWhile I generally caution against self-diagnosing, you may be on to something. If I were to work with you, some things I’d want to know about your symptoms include when you recognized that they are a problem; what, exactly, you mean by “bad OCD”; and what you are already doing to help yourself feel better. I’d also want to know how much your symptoms are interfering in your relationships, job/school, or other daily activities.When you are having symptoms (whether it be for an OCD diagnosis or for something else), the most important thing is that when you recognize you are suffering, you reach out for help. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you will have answers to your questions as they relate to you, and the sooner you’ll learn how to treat your symptoms. Seeking help now also enables you to change your thinking patterns while you are younger, which will have positive implications for your future (countering your anecdotal observation that mental health issues get worse with age, especially when left untreated).\n\nI hear your concern about whether symptoms will get better before they get worse; rest assured this fear is unwarranted. It is more likely that symptoms could get worse by not doing anything about them. As you noted, these symptoms are unlikely to resolve on their own without you doing something different.\n\nGenerally, obsessive thoughts and related symptoms are likely to improve when you commit to a course of therapy and not terminate prematurely. This might include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), another psychotherapeutic approach, medication, or a combination of the above. One important aspect of treatment effectiveness is learning to recognize what may be triggering your symptoms and how to avoid or prepare for these triggers in the future.\n\nThere are no guaranteed “cures” (meaning a promise of no relapses) for anything when it comes to OCD. Treatment will likely take time, and symptoms likely will not subside after just one session. If you start with an approach and it doesn’t seem like a comfortable fit, try to not get discouraged. There are multiple treatment options, and another approach may resonate better with you. Be patient with yourself and your progress.\n\nWith many mental health conditions, including OCD and anxiety, some of the most important things we can do are to learn how to build coping skills, increase self-awareness, promote self-compassion, and prevent relapses. In other words, it’s critical to be an active part of your treatment and self-monitor your symptoms."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Help My Adult Child\n with Depression?",
    "Question": "My adult daughter is incredibly gifted (she tested around 130 IQ), but she has pretty serious depression. The sleeps-all-day, forgets-to-eat kind. It took her an extra two years to graduate from college because she kept turning assignments in late. Once she got her engineering degree, everyone thought she’d get a job easily, but she bombed all her interviews. Eventually she ended up working as a waitress.\n\nShe’s been in therapy for a year now, and her more serious symptoms have improved. My daughter says she wants to quit her job and go to graduate school. However, she keeps procrastinating on applications and missing deadlines. When I try to ask about her progress, she clams up and shuts me out.\n\nI know she’s an adult now. I can’t do everything for her. But I would hate to see my daughter’s depression sabotage her career. All she needs is a little support for her condition.\n\nShould I take a more active role in guiding my child? Or is my daughter’s procrastination a sign she’s not actually ready for graduate school? I want her to reach her full potential, but I don’t want to push her into a situation she can’t handle.",
    "TherapistReply": "It can be so hard to watch someone you love struggle. It can be even harder when you feel so helpless. Your daughter is an adult, is in therapy, and has to be in charge of her future. Your desire to help her comes from a loving place, but sadly, it is not the kind of help she needs.\n\nOften when we try to help our kids by smoothing their path or taking care of things for them, we unintentionally signal that we’re not confident in their ability to manage things. This can reinforce their self-doubts and contribute to their sense of helplessness and ineffectiveness. What our kids need more often is to hear and see from us that we believe they can manage their lives, and that we are available for support if they want it. Then we must step back and let them fall and pick themselves back up. It can be excruciating to watch, and of course we can intervene when they are in serious or life-threatening danger. Failure to reach potential, though, doesn’t meet that standard.It’s also not unusual for kids, even as they enter adulthood, to push back against the expectations they believe others (especially parents) have of them. If your daughter feels you are more invested in her graduate school applications than she is, she may lose some of her own motivation. Ultimately, she will have to decide what she wants and how much she wants to pursue it. If she owns her choices and the results of those choices, good or bad, she will move into adulthood on better footing. Maybe grad school is the right choice for her now, maybe not. Either way, she must choose how to live her life and forge her own path.\n\nIf you are wondering how best to support your daughter, could you ask to meet with her and her therapist? Her therapist might be able to offer ideas about how to communicate effectively with your daughter and offer her loving support in a way that bolsters her sense of self-efficacy. If not, perhaps you could find a therapist to work with to share your fears and concerns and identify a way to manage the anxiety you feel on your daughter’s behalf."

    "QuestionTitle": "What Is Best for Alcoholism—Rehab,\n Alcoholics Anonymous, or Both?",
    "Question": "With the help of my friends and family, and particularly a recent intervention they had for me, I’m coming to terms with the fact I’m an alcoholic. I started drinking socially as a teenager. I drank excessively on a frequent basis and continued into adulthood. I am 31 years old, and until recently I didn’t think anything of my drinking habits. After getting a DUI and the intervention I mentioned, I’m realizing my alcoholism has impacted my life (and the lives of people I love) for a while now.\n\nI was a social drinker to start, even into my early 20s. Nowadays, I prefer to drink at home, usually by myself. It’s cheaper than going out to a bar, and coordinating plans with friends can be stressful and annoying. I can admit that I’ve been isolating to hide my drinking from others, to avoid needing to make excuses for drinking or having to explain whether I remember something or if I blacked out. The night I got my DUI, by the way, I don’t remember at all.\n\nMy recent experiences have shown me that I need help, but I don’t know where to start. Some people have recommended 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, and others think I need intensive rehab treatment. So I’m wondering which one I should try first. Should I try both? I have never tried to stop drinking and am worried that if I try to quit cold turkey, I will suffer severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and relapse. Please help me with some ideas on how to get started so I can plan the best recovery strategy.",
    "TherapistReply": "First of all, congratulations on taking a crucial first step: you have gotten honest with yourself and declared yourself powerless (in the language of recovery) over alcohol. As with all recovery concepts, should you go that route, you’ll get to decide what this means to you. One sober client said it to me this way: “To me, it means when I can control my drinking, I don’t enjoy it, and when I enjoy it, I can’t control it.”\n\nI have personally been in several recovery programs. I also worked as a counselor in a rehab facility and I now have my own private practice, so you’ve come to the right guy. It’s also true you’ll get “Darren’s take” here and—this is crucial—there is no “perfect” way to do this. A lot of sobriety is exploration, trial, and error. The only “mistake” is to give up and go back to the bottle.\n\nI firmly believe those of us on a sober path are not “bad” people trying to be “good”; we’re afflicted or wounded people trying to get well.\n\nIf you’re sober, you’re winning.\n\nThis is the best gift you could ever give yourself. You will not believe the mental and emotional freedom that comes with being sober.\n\nSome people find the “disease” model of addiction or alcoholism helpful. Others do not. You can decide. I like it, as do many of the people I work with in therapy, because it tends to reduce shame or stigma.\n\nIn other words, try not to be hard on yourself for having this problem. There are a lot of successful, even famous, people in recovery meetings here in Los Angeles. In a sense, you’re in good company.\n\nDon’t worry about why you drink, either. That becomes clearer with time. I think of it this way: an emotionally wounded or abused person seeks relief from alcohol, and then alcohol begins to abuse the person. It often repeats the earlier cycle of dysfunction and emotional turmoil with eerie accuracy.\n\nNow, to your question of “what next?” Again, no right answer. Your best bet is to check out different recovery meetings and call or visit rehabs. The point is to get into the habit of not drinking.It may be hard to tell, should you find yourself dissatisfied, if this is true dissatisfaction or fear of staying sober or the booze talking. Experience will answer, but again, the only “mistake” is to give up. Early sobriety can be a roller-coaster, which is why I suggest your sobriety include the following elements:\n\nA medical checkup. Medical guidance for detox is important. Some programs have detox on site, while others have detox centers that then transfer you to the on-site rehab program.\nA psychiatric evaluation. Ideally, this is done by someone experienced with alcoholism. You’ll want someone cautious—neither strict nor “pill happy.” Some medications are safer than others. Some people may need antidepressants in the beginning, others do not. There is no formula when it comes to this, nor is there shame in needing medication, if that’s what a doctor prescribes. Again, as long as you’re not drinking, you’re on the right track. A psychiatrist who is flexible but understands addiction is key.\nSocial support. Whether it is in recovery meetings or an outpatient or inpatient program, social support is crucial. Alcoholism thrives in isolation. You will know in your heart when you have found the right group of sober people, but don’t give up if it doesn’t happen right away. Keep seeking and you’ll find it.\nFinally, I recommend, should there be any issues with anxiety, depression, and so forth:\n\nCounseling or addiction therapy. This can happen right away or after you get used to not drinking. I am of the belief, being a therapist, that having at least a handful of sessions with an experienced counselor is helpful. There are reasons we drink, and stopping can be traumatic. It can feel like losing a loved one, strange as it sounds, or a rocky divorce, even if separation was long overdue.\nPeople recovering from alcoholism tend to have strong opinions. You may hear a lot of non-professional suggestions, which I suggest you take with a grain of salt if they are all-or-nothing, black-and-white. For instance, “Stay away from therapy, it’s all BS,” or, “You don’t need medication if you’re depressed, we’re ALL depressed,” or, “If you’re not going to 14 meetings a week, forget it,” or, “You must read the Bible to stay sober.” Nothing is black and white—except, well, you guessed it. Just keep your feet in motion."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Already Forgetting Words",
    "Question": "My memory isn’t so hot these days. I used to be a walking dictionary, but now I keep forgetting words. It happens every few days: I’ll be having a conversation, then stop because a word is on the tip of my tongue. Sometimes I’ll find it after an awkward pause. Other times I stammer through a few synonyms until the person offers the word for me.\n\nI can’t see any rhyme or reason to the words I forget. They don’t have a theme or anything. They aren’t always difficult words, either. If I’m tired or nervous, I can forget basic words like “umbrella.” Once, when I took my partner to a nice restaurant, I couldn’t remember the name for “pepper.” I had to ask her to pass “the spicy salt.”\n\nShould I be worried about this? My family does have a history of Alzheimer’s, but I’m only 32. Is becoming forgetful part of the aging process? Or am I just bad at conversation? I’m already self-conscious when talking to people, so I’d like to improve my memory if I can.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing in with this question. It sounds like this issue is creating a good deal of discomfort for you. I hear you saying there is some social anxiety associated with the issue but also anxiety around what it could suggest about future cognitive declines. That seems like a lot for you to hold. You don’t have to hold it alone.I wonder if scheduling a consult with a neuropsychologist or neurologist could be helpful to you. If you chose to schedule such a consult, it might be valuable to consider some of the following questions and have some notes to bring in. Was there a particular event, transition, or injury that occurred just before you became aware of this issue? Is the forgetfulness limited to word selection or do you find that you are forgetting other things as well? Do you find this is likely to come up in certain situations and not in others? If so, are there common themes in the situations where it does come up? Having answers to these questions will allow you to offer a thorough presentation of your concern.\n\nCertainly, the professional you see will also have some questions and may or may not find it necessary to recommend further evaluation. If there is an underlying condition causing the forgetfulness, it will likely be diagnosed. If no diagnosis is made, then hopefully your anxiety will be alleviated to some extent.\n\nIf there is not a neurological explanation for your forgetfulness and you still find it showing up and creating discomfort, it might be valuable to partner with a therapist to explore and deal with the anxiety you have around the issue. The social anxiety could certainly exacerbate the problem—anxiety can impair cognitive functioning. Working with a therapist on increasing your self-confidence and belief in your ability to navigate social situations might help to decrease the incidents simply by decreasing social anxiety. Even if the incidents did not decrease, you might not feel the same level of discomfort if you felt more confident overall.\n\nHowever you choose to approach this, I hope you will address it in some way. It sounds like it is quite stressful for you, and you deserve to have support in trying to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on and what can be done about it."

    "QuestionTitle": "Am I a Sociopath?",
    "Question": "I recently took one of those online quizzes you see on Facebook sometimes. This one was about whether you’re a sociopath or not. I love quizzes and polls, so I clicked. Now I’m sorry I did. According to this site, I am 80% sociopath!\n\nI don’t know what to think about this. I know it’s just an online quiz, but it came from a site that looked like it was pretty credible, and I will admit I have wondered in the past if there is something wrong with me. I don’t think I’m “better” than other people, but I do think I am smarter than most. I can also be really manipulative in order to stack the cards in my favor. More to the point, I lie a lot, and it works. But at the same time, I don’t feel good about lying, if that makes sense. I feel ashamed when I lie, but I justify it based on the self-serving results, and the shame I feel doesn’t stop me from doing it again.\n\nBesides lying, a lot of the questions on the quiz had to do with my ego and whether I feel empathy and regret. I think I do have a pretty big ego, but I also feel like I have good reason to. I would trust my own judgment over just about anyone’s, but I don’t think so highly of myself that I don’t recognize that there aren’t smarter or more educated people out there. Like, I’m not about to tell a doctor that I know more about medicine than they do. If my computer dies, I take it to someone who knows more about computers than I do. I know my limits. I don’t really feel bad for others very often and almost never cry, but it does happen. Also, I know I make mistakes just like others do. I can be very selfish, it’s true. But isn’t the fact I understand I’m selfish indicative of NOT being a sociopath?\n\nCan you tell me what the signs are of being a sociopath and whether you get the sense I am one? And if I am one, am I a lost cause or what?",
    "TherapistReply": "First, I want to caution you about taking any online “test” too seriously. They can be fun and diverting, but rarely do they meet the rigorous criteria of reliability and validity that are required of legitimate psychological tests. There is no site credible enough to allow someone to assign themselves an actual mental health diagnosis outside of work with a licensed professional. The training required to administer and interpret psychological testing is extensive, because knowing how to do so ethically and responsibly is essential and not something that can be done through, say, Facebook. Additionally, “sociopath” is not a recognized diagnosis from the DSM-5, the diagnostic manual used for mental health considerations. The closest diagnosis would be antisocial personality, and there are specific criteria that must be met to qualify for that diagnosis.\n\nI would suggest there is pretty strong evidence against you “being a sociopath”—primarily in the fact you are concerned that you might be one and this idea creates distress for you. Generally speaking, people with sociopathy are unconcerned about their behaviors and the impact of those behaviors on others. Feeling remorse about your actions or desires would contradict a diagnosis of antisocial personality.From what you describe, it sounds like you have a strong sense of self and confidence in your intellect and your abilities. It doesn’t sound as if you have grandiose ideas about your skills; you recognize the expertise of others and defer appropriately. Your ability to admit mistakes also doesn’t fit with what we might expect to find in someone who meets diagnostic criteria.\n\nIt does sound as if some of your choices cause you distress and concern, and it may be worthwhile to talk with a professional therapist about this. You might be able to explore, for example, why you use the strategies you do and how they serve (or don’t serve) you. You can also request legitimate assessments to evaluate the presence or absence of a diagnosis; however, those tests are not infallible and need to be understood within your specific context. A licensed professional with the right training in assessment could be a helpful resource. Additionally, a licensed professional would be able to help you put into perspective how your behaviors, thoughts, and feelings fall within the realm of normative human experience."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Get Out of Depression?",
    "Question": "I have been depressed for what seems like forever. My life took a terrible turn a few months ago: first my boyfriend broke up with me (and took all the money from our shared account, leaving me broke), then my dog had to be put down, then I fell and injured my leg and had to have surgery, then I got terribly sick, then I lost my job for having too take too much time off. I cannot catch a break.\n\nI just want to sleep all the time and don’t want to do anything anymore. I don’t answer the phone when friends call. I can’t concentrate. Sometimes I go to a very dark place and just want to end it all.\n\nWhen I feel this hopeless, it’s hard to see any kind of light at the end of the tunnel. I have been told to “just hang in there, it will get better” more times than I care to remember. I keep hanging in there and it’s not getting better! I don’t know what to do. Is there a way to get out of depression without catching some sort of break like winning the lottery and Prince Charming showing up at my door with a puppy?",
    "TherapistReply": "You have experienced a tremendous amount of loss in a relatively short period of time; considering this, I would be more surprised if you weren’t struggling to cope. I hope you are showing yourself some compassion. It’s hard to imagine anyone going through what you’ve gone through and bouncing back quickly. This may be somewhat cold comfort, but allowing ourselves to feel our pain is what ultimately allows us to process our grief. Even when it’s possible to set our pain aside without processing it, it finds its way back into our lives sooner or later.\n\nIn some instances people do go through difficult periods and experience some depressive features, and as the difficulty subsides, so do the depressive features. This hasn’t been the case for you. I think the problem with the notion of “hanging in there” and waiting for it get better on its own is that you have lost huge parts of your support system—your partner, your pet, your job, your savings, even your health.While time might be all that is required for your body to heal from injury and illness, you will need to take active steps to address the other losses you’ve experienced. Before you can begin rebuilding your life, you need to focus on healing from these losses. I would strongly encourage you to seek out a therapist who you can partner with to begin to process these losses and heal. Given the “dark place” your thoughts sometimes wander to, it’s especially important that you know help is available and people do care.\n\nAs your depressive symptoms remit, you will be in a better position to figure out what you would like your life to look like and how to go about creating that for yourself. Continuing to work with a therapist throughout this process will provide you with the support of the therapeutic relationship as you take risks and try on new behaviors. This will not be an easy process, but it is one that may bring you relief and then empower you to build and live the life you deserve."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Friend Is in an Abusive \nRelationship",
    "Question": "My best friend is in a nasty relationship. She never spends time with her friends anymore, because her man throws a jealous fit if she’s paying attention to anyone but him. When we all have double dates, he gets INCREDIBLY passive aggressive, always cracking jokes about her weight or her voice. My husband tried defending her once, only to get accused of flirting with her.\n\nMy friend used to be little miss sunshine, but now she’s miserable all the time. She’s always putting herself down, repeating her boyfriend’s insults. I’m worried she’s going to hurt herself if something doesn’t change.\n\nI’ve told my friend she needs to get the heck out, but she won’t listen. She thinks she can still save the relationship. It doesn’t help that she lives in his house. I’ve offered to let her crash at my place—my boy’s in college now, she could have his whole room to herself—but she just gets angry and offended. Once, she even threatened to stop talking to me.\n\nI don’t want to ruin our friendship, but I can’t stand to see my friend get hurt like this. I miss the happy, confident woman I used to know. Isn’t there anything I can do?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your message. Boy oh boy, it sounds like your friend has picked one humdinger of a boyfriend. He sounds as much fun as a mosh pit full of Dobermans. I can understand your sense of shock, dismay, maybe even loss, since your friend seems to have vanished into a hostage situation. Your desire to rescue her is also understandable.\n\nI have seen many people in therapy stuck somewhere on the spectrum of abusive relationships, from moderate to severe. Your friend’s situation sounds emotionally abusive, plus who knows what is happening behind the scenes. I have also counseled those outside a relationship looking in, wondering what they can do, if anything.\n\nFirst, let me describe a little bit of what might be happening with your friend, based on my clinical observations over the years—keeping in mind everyone is different and I can only speculate.\n\nMy intuition is your friend has, at one time or another (perhaps in childhood), experienced some kind of abuse, neglect, abandonment, or some/all of the above. The self-esteem that is being injured now by these not-so-passive aggressive cracks had, I suspect, already suffered injury long before Mr. Wonderful arrived. It’s possible no one, including yourself, detected this self-loathing or merciless self-criticism beneath the surface.\n\nOne thing I have learned is that becoming entrapped in such a hostile relationship has nothing to do with a person’s intelligence or strength. It has everything to do with a person’s psychological and emotional history. On some level, consciously or not, your friend may not believe she deserves better. At some point, she may have learned that one must tolerate such behavior to maintain close connection.In other words, there may be toxic core shame she has lived with for some time, secretly undermining another’s esteem and caring. I am sure it is impossible for you to imagine why she would put up with such treatment. Perhaps you are thinking, “Where is my best friend and how can I get her back?”\n\nBut here’s the rub: what you are trying isn’t working. The reason—if, again, I had to guess why—is she is probably, consciously or not, deeply ashamed of her situation; the fellow in question continues to weaken her ability to set boundaries, appropriately assert herself, and act with the esteem we are born with but that trauma, such as abandonment or abuse or neglect, has a way of eroding.\n\nShe may be, in short, reliving or enacting some kind of childhood (or later) trauma right in front of you. It is distressing because you are clearly a sensitive, rational person. These situations are deeply frustrating because they play out with such obvious wrongness and we feel helpless to stop them—rather like watching a loved one get run over by the same car again and again.\n\nThe reason your well-intentioned attempts are not working has nothing to do with you. Your friend is probably pushing you away to protect her own brittle self-esteem. I would bet she suspects you are right, but remains too debilitated to kick him to the curb.\n\nI have a few practical suggestions regarding your friend, and then one for you.\n\nIn this situation, the only thing you can control is your own behavior. You have the difficult task of deciding whether to spend time around this man. You may decide his behavior is too painful to witness repeatedly, and so you might tell your friend you miss “girl time” with her and you would like to see her one on one at least occasionally. If she cannot or will not agree—if the man of the hour must also attend—then you can decide if it’s simply too much for you."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Is It So Hard for Me to Say No?",
    "Question": "I feel so strung out lately. I definitely consider myself a people-pleaser. I tend to go out of my way to make sure friends, family, and coworkers are happy, even if it leaves me feeling drained and dissatisfied.\n\nThis problem is probably best exemplified by my difficulty saying no. Whether I’m being asked to help someone or getting invited to lunch, I don’t know how to decline without feeling terrible about myself. I want to be a good friend, and part of being a good friend is being there for people. It just leaves me ragged sometimes because, as an introvert, I need a good amount of time alone to recharge. I’m rarely able to do that. So I’m stressed a lot and just have the sense that time is flying by. I don’t feel grounded and at peace, and I think it all comes down to not attending to my own needs.\n\nDo you deal with this a lot in your practice? What do you tell people who have a hard time saying no to others? Some practical suggestions for how to say no respectfully would be helpful as well. Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you are exhausted in every conceivable way—it must be a difficult way to live your life. You are consistently putting everyone else before yourself, to your own detriment. One place to start tackling this issue is with a thorough exploration of it and its meaning to you. For example, what would it mean to you to say no? Are you concerned about what others would think, or not think, about you? How would this impact your relationships? How might it change how you view yourself? Partnering with a therapist to answer these questions could be quite helpful in developing a deeper understanding of the beliefs and feelings you have around this pattern of behavior.I wonder if engaging in such a process would lead you to the realization that being there for people is part of how you identify yourself. If this bears out, it seems possible that disappointing anyone feels so unthinkable because it effectively serves as a threat to your identity. If you view yourself as a “go-to” kind of person who always “comes through” for others, the simple act of saying no might challenge how you see yourself and your purpose in the world. If so, a therapist could be helpful to you in uncovering other aspects of your identity and shifting your focus to developing those areas. With a greater awareness and embrace of the many facets of your identity, saying no might naturally become much easier.\n\nI also want to be respectful of your request for some practical suggestions for saying no respectfully. You mention that even saying no to a lunch invitation is difficult for you. What if, instead of answering either yes or no, you allowed yourself to say something like, “Well, I can’t do it today, but how about next week?” As for requests that are less social and more about helping someone else, you can still try to schedule those things in a way that doesn’t feel overly burdensome for you. Sometimes, all the creative scheduling in the world won’t work and you may just have to say no. Even in these cases, you can still offer help through brainstorming about how else to address the issue and express your sincere regret that you aren’t able to help this time.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose to try some ideas for saying no or dive in to an exploration of the larger issues, you deserve to learn how to prioritize yourself and your needs. I hope you are able to find some ways to give yourself this gift."

    "QuestionTitle": "Do I Have an Eating Disorder or \nAm I Overthinking Things?",
    "Question": "I joined the all-natural trend years ago and loved it. I got more energy, built more muscle, stopped having stomach pains, etc. But my friends say I’m taking it too far, and I can’t tell if they’re right.\n\nI moved to a smaller town recently. There are only fast food chains here, so I cook all my own meals. If my stomach’s growling at work and I forgot to pack lunch, I usually go hungry. I figure it’s better to skip a meal than dump all that salt and sugar into my body.\n\nWhen my buddies and I go out for pizza, my brain obsesses over all the grease clogging my arteries. I have to force myself to pick up a slice, chew, and swallow. It’s like my body knows it’s eating chemicals. But if I skip pizza and stick to beer, my friends get worried.\n\nI’m not anorexic. I’m fine with being a big guy. Actually, not to brag, but I can bench a full 230 pounds. All I care about is being healthy. My dad died of a heart attack when he was only 42. I’d rather skip pizza night than end up like him.\n\nA healthy body is a good trade-off for being a picky eater, right? Or are my friends on to something and I’m just in denial?",
    "TherapistReply": "First and foremost, you are certainly not alone in wondering how far is too far when it comes to healthy lifestyle choices. The line that divides “healthy or unhealthy” is often a porous barrier rather than a hard and fast wall. It sounds like you’ve put a fair amount of thought into your choices around food for some time. I can imagine having a parent die at a young age from a heart attack would be a massive wake-up call to take your health seriously and make some positive changes in that area. I can also imagine that, in your mind, adopting the all-natural food trend, to some degree, is a way to feel protected from a similar fate.\n\nI’m assuming the concern you and your friends have is if these food patterns are leading you down the path to an eating disorder. To help provide some guidance, let’s get some definitions out of the way. Engaging in disordered eating patterns—potentially dangerous behaviors around food, body, and exercise—doesn’t mean you automatically have a full-blown eating disorder. Orthorexia, for example, encompasses a wide range of behaviors where the focus isn’t necessarily on weight or body size, but rather on the perceived health or purity of food consumed. It is also important to point out that many myths surround eating disorders, one of which is that you must be severely underweight or physically weak. The truth is eating disorders and disordered eating patterns impact people of all walks of life, body shapes, ages, and genders. In fact, many individuals who struggle with disordered eating can be at or slightly above “normal” body weight and size.What stands out to me is not only have your friends voiced some concerns with you (kudos to them!) but you also seem to share their worries about some of your food rules. Red flags to any eating disorder therapist are a hypervigilance around food, fears of how food impacts the person’s body, and skipping meals in the service of perceived benefit to the person’s body. What I am hearing in your letter that concerns me is the lack of flexibility around food in your life, justifications to skip meals if you have forgotten to pack a lunch, and sticking to only beer in order to avoid potentially unhealthy food. You also say that you can obsess over what you believe is happening to your body if you have some greasy food. While this may not be your thought process, it seems that at least a small part of you truly believes that pizza, for example, will harm your body—almost immediately—to the point that you have developed a physical aversion and must force yourself to take bites. I’m sure you’ve already guessed this, but that suggests it might be worthwhile to explore what’s going on underneath these rigid food rules that you adhere to.\n\nI hear your very real concern that unhealthy eating habits could contribute to you leading a life where you follow your dad’s fate. My number one phrase to people in therapy is “it’s not about the food.” What I mean by this is it isn’t the food itself that causes distress but rather our relationship to the food. I can imagine your beliefs about food are closely related to your fears of following your dad’s path and dying young. A common goal among individuals working through disordered eating is to strive for balance with food and exercise choices. After all, even the American Heart Association doesn’t mandate a total avoidance of pizza and fast food. Increasing our ability to find intuitive balance and moderation with ALL foods can be what allows us to let go of rigid fear-based rules and even enjoy a slice every now and then.\n\nI can imagine the idea of having disordered eating patterns is of concern to you, otherwise you wouldn’t be writing or taking your friends’ concerns to heart. The good news is it is possible to work through disordered eating patterns with a trained therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Learning new ways to relate to your body and food can help you increase flexibility in your daily life and decrease stress related to food. Remember, this isn’t about “good” and “bad” foods, but rather developing a positive relationship with food where you can make balanced decisions that don’t inhibit you from living a full life. I believe that with the guidance of a professional, you can make positive strides toward a more balanced relationship with food while honoring your desire to lead a healthy life."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Want Real Answers to My\n Existential Questions",
    "Question": "Lately, I’ve been feeling like I really don’t belong in my life and my body and possibly even this universe. Every time I try and Google this feeling for some clarity, I get blogs about spirituality. Which I’m open to, but that’s part of the problem. Because the only answer I’ve gotten is couched in New Age mysticism, I find my perceptions changing, possibly not for the better.\n\nI’ve gotten different diagnoses in my life, including ADD, major depressive disorder, and manic depressive disorder. It’s unclear what is true or even if that’s relevant, but I’d really appreciate any idea that isn’t “you’re an alien on earth,” “your third eye is opening,” or “your soul is ancient.” Because I haven’t given up yet on one day becoming a person who is conventionally okay. I’ll never be neurotypical, but I want to understand what this alienation is and where it comes from. Thank you for your time.",
    "TherapistReply": "I don’t know if you have attention-deficit hyperactivity, if you’re manic depressive, or even if you’re depressive. I have no idea if your “third eye” is opening or if you’re an alien, although if you are an alien, you might research other options before you set your heart on Earth. Perhaps you already have. I also don’t know your age or the age of your soul, ancient or otherwise.\n\nAlthough I can’t diagnose your situation from your letter, I do have some thoughts I’d like to share. I wonder if you have ever been in a traumatic, possibly life-threatening, situation. Exposure to trauma may produce experiences of “unreality,” which is one possible interpretation of your feelings of not belonging in your life, your body, and maybe this universe. Feelings of alienation often go together with acute anxiety states.I wonder, too, if you try to ground yourself—and if you do, how? Working with a therapist who can teach you grounding techniques while you learn more about your thoughts and behavior might be helpful.\n\nYou write that your perceptions are “changing, possibly not for the better.” I’m not sure what you mean. Are you finding different meanings in things and reacting differently to things than you used to? Are you referring to your relationships with others?\n\nIt also seems to me that you may be searching for meaning. In 1946, Viktor Frankl wrote a book called Man’s Search for Meaning. It’s an old book, but the ideas it contains may be relevant to you. Frankl survived being imprisoned in a concentration camp, and he did so in part by imagining a purpose in his life and then focusing his attention on accomplishing that purpose. People who are able to find meaning, often involving helping others, typically feel a sense of tremendous strength as well as peace.\n\nThis page contains at least one affiliate link for the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, which means GoodTherapy.org receives financial compensation if you make a purchase using an Amazon link.\nPeople often find their strength and peace through association with others. We all need to feel connected in some way. I would suggest you find a therapist or mentor who can help you sort out, in person and in depth, your life in this confusing universe.\n\nI say “this universe” because that’s the one we find ourselves in. I am not going to refer to “alternative universes” or New Age mysticism, although these concepts have their appeal to me, as they may to you. My feeling is we need to take care of ourselves in this world and this universe before we start worrying about any alternate realities—a sort of grounded, one-thing-at-a-time approach.\n\nYou may also want to consult a neurologist to investigate any possible biological substrate of your experience. This may sound scary, but I find that eliminating the unlikeliest causes of one’s concerns makes the likelier ones seem less daunting."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Teenage Daughter Hates Me",
    "Question": "My 16-year-old daughter thinks I’m evil. Anytime I try to use discipline, whether it’s asking her to help around the house or do her homework, I get attitude and viciousness. In recent months she has even taken to saying she hates me. Last night she told me, “I hate your (expletive) guts!” Then she called me another expletive and told me to stay out of her life. I am still sobbing as I write this.\n\nI don’t know what I did to make my daughter treat me like this. I may not be a banner parent, but I do my best to make sure she has what she needs and some of what she wants. She’s really ungrateful and has no respect for me anymore. She has threatened to go live with her dad a few times now (he lives two states away), and I’m just about ready to tell her to go.\n\nIt breaks my heart to see my child acting this way toward me and I want to fix our relationship if I can. But I can’t get through to her at all, so I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like a complete failure as a parent. Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "The agony of your heartbreak is so clear—it is devastating to have your child speak to you in such a hateful manner. That agony has a way of making things seem worse than they actually are. You end your letter by saying you “feel like a complete failure as a parent,” but you also said you “make sure she has what she needs and some of what she wants.” If you are covering her needs and some of her wants, you are succeeding in at least one area, and I imagine there are other areas of parenting where you are also quite successful.\n\nIt sounds like you are unable to trace her behavior back to any particular incident, which is likely making her behavior all the more baffling. Thus, you feel unsure how to approach the issue. This also makes it seem possible that the issue isn’t really you. Sometimes children lash out at their parents even when their angst has little to do with their parents. Parents can be safe targets—friends might decide not to be friends and boyfriends/girlfriends might break up, but parents don’t stop being parents and don’t stop loving their children.You also mention that her father lives two states away and your daughter has expressed an interest in going to live with him. I’m curious how long he has lived two states away. Is this a more recent development that she might be having a hard time adjusting to? Does she blame you, fairly or unfairly, for the geographical distance? I imagine her request to live with him is quite difficult to hear, but affording her the opportunity to speak openly and honestly about why she is feeling this way might be beneficial to your relationship with one another.\n\nI also find myself feeling curious about what is going on in her life beyond the fact her father lives two states away. Have her relationships with anyone else—friends or significant others—changed? Has there been any kind of change at school? Has her performance in school changed significantly? Examining some of these issues might offer some ideas about other things, outside of your relationship with your daughter, that might be impacting her and how she treats you. If you’re unsure of these potential issues, maybe there is a guidance counselor or teacher at her school that you could check in with.\n\nI wonder if there are any times of relative peace between the two of you in the home. If so, one of these moments might provide a good opportunity to let her know you are concerned about her and are open to listening to anything she might wish to share. Sometimes, approaching someone in the absence of conflict can change the complexion of a typical interaction.\n\nFinally, I would encourage you to consider seeking out your own therapy. Parenting is one of the most intense experiences there is, and going through something like this is incredibly painful. You deserve not only the support a therapeutic relationship can provide, but also the opportunity to brainstorm new strategies for and approaches to connecting with your daughter and healing the relationship."

    "QuestionTitle": "Who Knows What’s Best for Me: My Therapist or Me?",
    "Question": "I have been in therapy for four and a half years. Although I’ve made major changes in my life, I’ve not yet tackled the initial problem which took me to therapy in the first place. I feel like I get mixed messages from my therapist. Sometimes he encourages me to be more open, other times to “not go there.” I want to work through some difficult baggage, but today he said it’s acceptable to put a metaphorical Band-Aid on a wound and carry on limping through life.\n\nI get the feeling he’s holding back when I want to go forward. It feels like he doesn’t trust me to be okay while doing the work. It took me a very long time to learn to trust him, and it feels a bit hypocritical if he can’t take the same risk trusting me. I’ve invested so much to get to this point, only to stall at the last hurdle.\n\nI know if a therapist doesn’t have experience in certain areas, it is unethical to say they can help when they can’t. I have a dissociative disorder, and where I live there are no therapists experienced in treating dissociation. Changing therapists is not an option. I’m at as good a place as any at the moment, but cannot fix this by myself. I don’t want an expert, I want someone “good enough” to hold my hand and walk me through it.\n\nI’m torn between pushing forward toward healing or trusting his judgment and accepting the idea of limping through life with a Band-Aid. If I had a choice, I know which option I would choose. Ultimately, who knows what’s best for me, my therapist or me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing in with such a rich, complex question. Before I address it, I’d like to take a moment to commend you on the strong commitment and incredible work you have already done in therapy. You say you had to work hard to learn how to trust your therapist and have worked over the course of several years to make major life changes. It is no wonder you are ready to take this work to the next level. You’ve seen what you can gain from committing to the process and you want even more.\n\nFirst, I’d like to jump into some potential issues I see developing in the therapeutic relationship. People share things with their therapists that they wouldn’t share with anyone else, but they still often feel they can’t, or shouldn’t, comment on their experience of the therapist and the process of therapy. These are things that need to be discussed in therapy. You say that after working so hard to learn to trust him, it feels hypocritical that he does not trust you. I would strongly encourage you to speak to him about this. I’m concerned the trust you worked so hard to develop will be eroded if you harbor resentment at his lack of trust in you. This could create a fracture that only deepens and becomes toxic to the therapeutic relationship.\n\nAnother potential threat to the therapeutic relationship is the lack of alignment in regard to therapeutic goals. Goal-setting in therapy is ideally a collaborative process. While collaborative, it should be largely driven by what the person in therapy wants to gain from the work, with the therapist ensuring the goals are realistic and healthy. Again, here’s where I would encourage you to have an open conversation with your therapist about the goals you would like to begin working toward. If he disagrees with that direction, he should be able to tell you why.This leads into the ethical issue you mentioned. You are correct in your understanding that it is unethical for a therapist to treat someone with an issue or condition they lack experience and training in. This might very well be why he is pulling back. Again, this should be an open conversation. If he is hesitating to move forward because he lacks the expertise, he should be transparent about that. If that is his concern, perhaps you can talk to him about the possibility of him engaging in his own supervision. While there might not be any therapists with expertise in dissociation in your area, he can be supervised remotely by a therapist who does have the expertise.\n\nThe idea of remote supervision leads to me raise the possibility of remote work for you, too. I know you say changing therapists isn’t an option; I wonder if that is purely about availability or if you hesitate to change therapists for other reasons (i.e., needing to establish a therapeutic relationship with someone new). Telehealth (or online/distance therapy) is becoming a fairly common answer to a lack of qualified professionals in a given area. Perhaps there could even be a way that a new, remote therapist with expertise in dissociative issues could work with you and your therapist. Certainly, both therapists could consult as you transitioned from your current therapist to a new one, but maybe a team approach could be employed and you could work with both. In such a situation, there would need to be a clear agreement between the three of you regarding roles and boundaries for the arrangement to be ethically sound.\n\nThe bottom line is this: You are the expert on you. You want to take your work to the next level in order to achieve greater healing and change than you already have. You deserve to have the opportunity to do more than limp through life."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Am I So Sensitive?",
    "Question": "I think I’m more sensitive than most people. I get offended or my feelings get hurt really easily. Even things that don’t directly affect me … well, affect me.\n\nI’m as sensitive as I know how to be, if that makes sense. Is there a way to learn how to be less sensitive? If something makes me feel angry, sad, anxious, guilty, shameful, fearful, or jealous, is there anything I can do about it? I worry that something is wrong with me because I can’t stop myself from feeling these things.\n\nMy boyfriend has told me over and over I need to stop being so sensitive and I need therapy. He’s not the only one who has said I’m too sensitive. It upsets me (probably because I’m so sensitive). I can’t win. Why am I so sensitive?",
    "TherapistReply": "Many people have strong feelings—that’s neither a failure nor a triumph, it’s just how they are. From what you’ve written, it’s how you are.\n\nYou listed a slew of feelings that affect you: anger, sorrow, anxiety, guilt, shame, fear, and jealousy, and I’d bet there are more! You’re human. You have a big heart.\n\nYou worry you can’t stop yourself from feeling things. That’s okay. Your feelings are your feelings; there’s nothing wrong with them and you shouldn’t stop them. What you can do is work on how you express those feelings. It is possible to have a strong reaction, and then pause, and then decide how you’ll express yourself. The trick is building in that pause. That takes a lot of practice, but it’s worthwhile.\n\nHere are some thoughts about building in some time for yourself:\n\nAs soon as you recognize that you’re feeling something, name the feeling and accept it. Take some deep breaths. Can you find some humor in the situation? I detect a good sense of humor in your letter.\nDecide what to do with the feeling you’re experiencing. Express it straight out, full force? Or modulate your expression, kind of like louder or quieter, bigger or smaller? This is tough. You may have to practice a lot—it’s unlikely you will be able to do it right away—so give yourself permission to fail and try again. Remember the learning curve. It takes time. No one progresses in a straight line; there are ups and downs. That’s just how it works. For everybody. I’d like to suggest a couple of additional processes that might help. First, learn meditation, yoga, or some form of self-study that emphasizes the body and the breath. Learning how to focus on your breath will give you time and the opportunity to decide when, how, and even if you will react to your feelings. Remember, you’ll recognize, name, and accept those feelings first, but after that you might or might not act on them.\n\nAnother good way to learn about your feelings, what they mean, and how to live with them is to find a good therapist and schedule a session. Feelings are what make us human. We get even more human when we learn to recognize feelings and know what to do about them; a therapist will help you understand your actions and reactions and why they happen.\n\nYou write that your boyfriend tells you to “stop being so sensitive.” It sounds as if you feel he is criticizing you for who you are, but who you are—a sensitive person—is likely part of why he is attracted to you in the first place. You also report that he says you “need” therapy. I think therapy would be helpful for you, based on what you’ve expressed, and perhaps it would be for him, too.\n\nMany times when people get frustrated at their loved ones, they say something like, “You need therapy.” It may sound like your boyfriend is saying you’re crazy, which is unfortunate because (1) there’s nothing wrong with you and (2) it casts therapy, a terrific tool for understanding what makes us tick, in a stigmatizing light. Therapy starts to sound like a punishment, but it isn’t—it’s just a way for people to grow into themselves. The ability to learn and develop yourself is a great blessing."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Don’t Want to Hang Out with My Friends Who Drink",
    "Question": "I hope you can help me with something. Recently I decided I don’t want to drink anymore. I was never a big drinker to begin with and don’t have an alcohol problem, but when I hung out with my friends, I would often have two or three drinks, which is fairly typical for everyone in our group. But even though it feels good in the moment and makes me more social, I don’t like the way I feel after drinking alcohol, and that’s increasingly true as I get older (I just turned 35). It pretty much ruins the next day for me, as I barely feel like getting out of bed, let alone leaving my apartment.\n\nThis is a hard decision for me because I really like my friends and I don’t expect them to not drink around me. But it feels weird sometimes to be the only person who isn’t drinking—almost like I’m the one person who isn’t in on the joke. It’s just not as fun. I also don’t want to feel pressured to drink, even though I know my friends wouldn’t actively try to get me to do something I wasn’t comfortable with. Likewise, I also don’t want my friends to feel pressured to not drink just because I choose to abstain. I’m worried they will think I think they have a problem or that I am judging them.",
    "TherapistReply": "Congratulations on a mature decision. I guess I have my own sober thought, which is (with all due respect to your friends): are there any social activities to choose from besides imbibing, especially at 35? I can understand this as the focus at 25, but as one’s 30s roll around, the “party” kind of peters out and new responsibilities—work, family, etc.—eke into the foreground. It sounds like this is where you are going with your admirable decision, quite appropriate for someone a few years from 40.\n\nOf course, this is a generalization, and there are some professions—journalism, entertainment, trading, and tech, to name a few—where “getting drinks” can be almost ritualistic. But many folks in those professions are sober, or can have one or two and then head home, in some cases to their partner or kids. The focus becomes less the booze than the socializing. Plus, as you astutely state, as we get older it often gets harder to shake off liquor’s aftereffects.\n\nAre there any alternatives for your group besides drinking? I would think your friends would support your decision, and wonder why you wouldn’t tell them. (More on that in a moment.)\n\nI can understand feeling like the “odd person out” if you are not partaking. Though I can’t imagine that, if they truly are friends, they would mind trying something different now and again, especially if you are in a city. There are plenty of ways to hang out or blow off steam: music, readings, dancing, theater, comedy clubs, etc.\n\nIf the main focus of this gang is the liquor, that itself is worth a ponder. Perhaps it’s worth expanding your social circle in any event; try going online and finding a hiking group or even a language, photography, or cooking class (or whatever moves you). Perhaps you could get more involved with local community or, if you’re so inclined, religious or spiritual activities. Familiarity and routine can be comforting, but may also keep our worlds smaller than is needed.I am intuiting that this group may be a holdover from college, or that you work together? True friendships would have more than only that in common; the underlying anxiety in your question makes me wonder if you are concerned you’ll be alone if you lose this group, though again, if they are not willing to be flexible, how reliable are they? Perhaps you fear feeling rejected or seen as “wimpy” for not drinking. You don’t sound judgmental and your decision is sound; anyone judging you is not much of a friend.\n\nI can share with you some personal experience, which parallels others’ experience, though my situation is slightly different than yours. When I got sober and began recovery, with an alcohol problem that had me at the end of my rope, only two people protested that sobriety was “going overboard”; one smoked marijuana regularly, while the other had a problem (long hidden) with “downers.” The rest of my friends were congratulatory and flexible in joining me in new activities. It was something of a revelation that they were happy to see me and not the bottle.\n\nIn fact, I was shocked to discover most people truly don’t care about another’s drinking, and most don’t get smashed at social occasions. The latter was truly revelatory to me. Even now, at intimate dinner parties, it’s rare that anyone comments on (or even notices!) my having juice rather than wine.\n\nI find that as we get older, the time we get to spend with our friends becomes more and more precious as our lives fill up with more responsibilities, especially if we start a family. It’s good to be able to savor it as much as we can. (Is dating a goal or interest of yours, by the way? I am sure any worthy partner would respect your decision.)\n\nFinally, I detect anxiety in your decision about your effect on others. Contrary to many self-help affirmations (such as “I don’t need anyone’s approval”), most of us do care—at least a little—about how others perceive us. But there comes a time when we have to decide what’s best for us … and see who stands by us. It is not always an easy choice, and I wonder if you are beholden to the opinions of the group in a way that limits your choices. If so, it might be worth some non-critical self-reflection as to why. It has taken me quite some time to finally accept that we cannot control how or what others think of us, even when we prefer those thoughts to be positive.\n\nAny friendship worth its salt relies—to some degree, at least—on flexibility and empathy. It sounds like you have good reasons to set aside the booze to improve the quality of your life, and for that you are to be commended. My hope is you find that your friends are more supportive than you think."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! Caregiving for My Parent Is Making Me Resentful",
    "Question": "After three years of caring for my terminally ill mother, I have just about had it. I uprooted my life to care for her—leaving my husband and giving up a great job in a city I loved—and there is still no end in sight. I love my mom very much, but this is not what I signed up for. I thought it would be a year or two at the most, but she is a tough old lady and she’s fighting the good fight. On the one hand, I am proud of her and this must mean I’m doing a pretty job of caregiving. On the other, I am starting to become resentful, which I feel incredibly guilty about.\n\nI certainly don’t want my mom to die. I’m not going to stop giving her the best care she can get. But I am beyond burnt out, my life is on indefinite hold, and I’m lonely and broke. I have no life outside of caring for my mom. Basically, I am hating the universe right now. Please tell me I’m not crazy for feeling all this stuff.",
    "TherapistReply": "You are absolutely not crazy for feeling all this stuff. In fact, I’m amazed it took three years to get there! What you are describing is an untenable situation where you are being pulled by so many competing needs. Of course you want to care for your dying mother. Of course you resent leaving a job/city/husband you loved to do so.\n\nAlthough I don’t know all the details of your circumstances, I wonder about the process that led to your decision to uproot everything to care for your mom. There are many levels of care we can offer loved ones who are struggling. You chose to put the relationship you have with your mother over all other relationships in your life—your professional ones, your partner one, and even the one with yourself—indefinitely. It is painful when our various roles come into conflict. Often, we have to temporarily shift more energy and time to one at the expense of the others, but it is not reasonable to imagine we can sustain ourselves when we neglect all the other parts of our lives. You cannot fill from an empty vessel, and it sounds as if, after three years, your vessel is pretty empty.I wonder what options you have explored or what might be available to you. Can you attend to some of your mother’s caretaking needs without sacrificing all the other parts of your world? What sources of support might be available to you—even for respite care? I recommend finding a therapist near you to explore not only some of the options you might have, but also to process frustration and guilt you’ve been feeling. Many of the bereaved individuals I’ve worked with share a common experience of feeling a bit of relief after their loved one passed, or even having moments of wishing it was over so they could be relieved, and then feeling tremendous guilt about that. It’s natural to feel all of those things.\n\nI wonder what conversations you’ve had with your mother about her needs and her expectations of you. Could she potentially identify ways in which you can shift how you are supporting her while still ensuring she gets the care she needs? Knowing she is stronger than everyone expected, it might be time to talk about altering the plans for a more indefinite timeline. I imagine she also has a complex set of feelings about watching you give up your life to care for her. She may want the same things you do. Perhaps together you can find ways for you to be involved in her care, but not to sacrifice your entire world indefinitely."

    "QuestionTitle": "It Needs to Happen, but the Idea of Creating a Will Makes Me Anxious",
    "Question": "I’ve managed to get to age 66 without writing a will. The thought has always terrified me, but now it’s more real than ever. As my kids start (gently) pressuring me to consider talking to a lawyer about finally drawing one up, I’m feeling more and more anxious about it.\n\nDeath doesn’t really scare me so much, but having a document that my family will read when I die makes it terribly real. It brings up images in my head of them all going through it together and everything being so final. I know I’m at an age where I can no longer ignore it or put it off, but I stubbornly want to never deal with it.\n\nDo you have any advice for someone who is anxious to tears about doing this? Or any thoughts about how to get through the process without falling apart?",
    "TherapistReply": "I’m sorry to hear about your struggle. End-of-life matters are inherently unpleasant, but it sounds like your anxiety is running overtime and making those matters much worse. First and foremost, I recommend working with a therapist who can help you better understand the nature and origin of your anxious feelings. That insight may yield opportunities to identify soothing and coping strategies that make it easier for you to follow through on the difficult task of developing a will.\n\n“Thy will be done”—sooner rather than later. And although you didn’t ask, this applies to health proxies and powers of attorney as well. These are important legal documents designed to safeguard yourself and your family. See a lawyer, then write, sign, and file these papers, which are designed to make everyone’s life easier, including your own. Tell your kids where they can find them. Give them copies.\n\nThe original documents should be kept in a safe place. Safe place doesn’t necessarily mean safe deposit box, because your kids will not be able to enter that box without your prior written permission. Arrange with the bank and one of your kids so they have permission to open the box; otherwise, they will need a court order. Give that kid their own key and let them all know where your bank is.\n\nIn fact, organize your financial documents and tell your kids where they are. I keep mine in the upper left-hand drawer of my desk, and my kids know that. Let your kids know the names and contact information for your doctors, lawyers, and bank. Make a list of important information and give it to them. You will also need to ask someone to be your executor, the person in charge of carrying out your wishes.\n\nIf it seems like I speak from experience, it’s because I do. I have a will, and it divides my estate among family members and gives a little bit to the public library and some other places.\n\nI assume you have assets. If you become seriously ill, your kids may need these assets to help pay for your medical care. Make it easy for them in both your life and your death, which, you write, “doesn’t scare you.” Just thinking about it does! Yes, this all makes the prospect of your death terribly real. Death is terribly real for everybody; unfortunately, ignoring it doesn’t prevent it.You write that you “stubbornly” don’t want to deal with your eventual death, but it’s your kids who will have to deal with it. Your kids will be dealing with their sorrow and maybe also their frustration with your unwillingness to prepare for their future without you. You sound like you love them, and I’m guessing if you’re 66 they may be in their 30s or 40s, which means you’ve seen them through many difficulties and perhaps crises of their own. Here’s your last chance—literally the last—to take care of your kids. Do it for your kids, if not for yourself.\n\nYou’re concerned about your family reading your will, but you don’t say what it is that concerns you. Yes, it is sad to think of your kids reading your final wishes and reacting to your death. It’s even worse thinking of them having to sort out your finances while they are in states of grief. They’ll be grieving if you don’t have a will or if you do have one, but I imagine they’ll feel worse if you haven’t prepared them for how you want things to go when you die. They have been asking you, after all. They’re concerned. Would they be angry with you if you don’t have a will?\n\nYou worry about “falling apart” while getting this all together. I’m not sure what you mean by that, but I do know that by 66 you’ve done a lot of hard things, probably fell apart doing some of them, and then put yourself back together. Here’s your chance to do that again. You might ask a trusted friend or relative if they can help, or you might consult a therapist along the way. Aging gives us many things to worry about; death may be the least of them.\n\nIt is very painful to imagine yourself separated from the people you love. You won’t know what happens next in their stories, and that is sad. I personally would love to meet my great grandchildren and their children, too, or at least see into the future and know their biographies. Our children’s lives will go on without us, as they should. But as their lives proceed, the part we played continues to live on within them. Keep those memories clear, lead the way forward, and show them a positive model of aging and death."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Having Second Thoughts About Quitting My Job",
    "Question": "I left my job about two months ago, run-down and on the brink of something drastic because of how miserable I was. It was an extremely high-stress job in finance, and I was very good at it despite the long hours and the lack of creativity it took to do the job. Quitting it was a huge risk—I had savings, but no real prospects on the other side. I just wanted some peace after a decade of work that was at once mind-numbing and incredibly taxing.\n\nSince I left I’ve been making ends meet with some odd jobs, but after two months the thought is starting to creep in that I made a huge mistake. Life hasn’t been as fulfilling as I dreamed it would be, and though I have time and freedom now to explore hobbies I’ve wanted to take up and complete some lingering house projects, I seem to be … still stuck, somehow.\n\nMaybe I had too many expectations for quitting? Did I build it up too much in my head? The company I just left has an opening, and part of me wants to return. My best friends are there, but I dread every other aspect of being employed there again. At the time, I thought quitting was the best decision I ever made and I vowed never to go back. Should I listen to my nagging regrets? Try harder to make a new life for myself? Or opt for stability and doing what I know?",
    "TherapistReply": "As is so often the case (sayeth the psychotherapist), it raises more questions than answers. But first, let me make an observation or two.\n\nWe are often confused by the question of, “Is it the external circumstances that are the problem here, or is it me?” Typically, it is both. In fact, part of the problem can be seeing it as strictly either/or. Some of us grew up in misattuned environments, for instance, where we were always the problem. Some people in therapy also struggle because “they”/“him”/“her” is at fault.\n\nThere are always exceptions, but most of the time an external situation—especially a stressful one—is a catalyst for some psychological or emotional conflict we are sorting through. We cannot avoid seeing everything through our own “glasses” or filters. And everyone has ongoing, unsorted conflicts; there is no normal in this regard, as each person’s psychic conflict is highly individualized.\n\nIt sounds here as if the job was undoubtedly stressful, and no one can fault you for being a “quitter” since you hung in for a decade! One of our most basic needs is precisely what you stated—peace. I can confirm that the financial industry is anything but peaceful, what with the advent of ever-faster technological tools which seem to increase impatience from management and demand on workers. It is inherently a nerve-wracking business since it involves money, which touches on widespread fears and needs for security, leading to ongoing, socio-cultural anxiety and neurosis.\n\nSo the pressure was on, and from the sound of it, you prospered. That is no small feat. Clearly, you have marketable skills and can perform under pressure, to your credit, with a solid résumé that speaks to a decade of experience in a stressful environment.\n\nYet, in spite of your palpable relief at leaving, something lingers: self-doubt, a creeping sense of “what if I goofed?” This, to me, is probably the most emotionally significant part of your story.\n\nStability is, at least in part, an inside job. I have worked with quite a few wealthy individuals in therapy who were terribly unhappy. (I am not saying being able to pay bills and rent is insignificant.) In this case, though, it sounds like you have sufficient funds for now and can “make ends meet.” So rather than focus on the externals (the job opening, the company) or looking in the rearview mirror (“did I screw up by quitting?”), I would suggest you take time for sustained, empathic self-reflection.\n\nHave you considered speaking with a therapist, career counselor, or another professional who has experience helping folks with precisely these concerns? Something new awaits—something good, I am sensing—but it’s hard to know which door to open, or where the door can even be found. This, in turn, stokes fear.\n\nI strongly sense there is also a sense of conflict within yourself that wants security and certainty and peace or serenity, a sense of wholeness within the kind of work that truly, in the long run, is right for you. This is a tricky balance, one that requires more work and exploring on your part, but I am sure it is possible. You might not find perfection, but I am certain you can get inside the ballpark.\n\nRenowned psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott would call this yearning for peace as coming from your “true self,” while mythologist and Jungian author Joseph Campbell might call this process the beginning of your “hero’s journey,” or journey to authentic selfhood.\n\nCampbell stated that the hero most often refused the “call to adventure” at first, deciding to take that journey only when backed into a corner. Carl Jung himself felt it is only when cornered, or up against a wall, that our conscious mind surrenders to deeper, creative forces seeking actualization, carrying us forward like the currents of a river.\n\nOr, as an old Zen parable puts it, we are the train on the tracks, but we cannot be the tracks.\n\nI sense, in other words, that you need to give the quieter “other side”—which wants peace or something different, which nagged you to quit the job—a little space and patience to speak up. (Journaling can help in this regard, or talking to a professional or a trusted friend.) There is always existential anxiety at giving up a path of certainty—the financial job, where you know you can succeed and make a good living—for the blank canvas of what next. But that is precisely the adventure! In a way, we need that anxiety to keep our search in motion. And it is trial and error; don’t give up if the answer doesn’t appear right away. It will, though answers come in bits and pieces. Dramatic “aha!” moments are, for the most part, best left for movies and television.\n\nI’m guessing your courageous decision, which was a bold and necessary step to protect your sanity and serenity, has provoked deep-rooted voices—parental, perhaps?—that are saying things like, “Are you crazy? That job paid $_____ a year! Now what are you going to do? Watch daytime TV?”\n\nThat is the voice of fear. Fear tends to lead to black-and-white perception, where you are either secure or screwed.\n\nBut you have marketable skills, as I say. From a more neutral vantage point, I would guess you have options. By calming your fear and finding outlets for existential self-soothing, you might start to see that you could, for instance, work part-time for a company or even for yourself. And you are making ends meet, which might be good enough for now until you find something that resonates."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Can’t I Stop Worrying About Money?",
    "Question": "I constantly worry about money. I don’t even live paycheck-to-paycheck or anything. I just have this constant nagging fear that I’ll end up destitute and unable to support myself, even though I have several years’ worth of “rainy day” funds. Knowing I’m going to be okay is really important to me, and I don’t know how to make myself feel that way—no matter what position I put myself in financially. I don’t even know how much it would take in the bank for me to feel secure. A million dollars probably wouldn’t do it.\n\nMy family wasn’t well off by any means, but also didn’t seem to struggle, so I don’t think my issue is related to that. I was laid off in 2008 and went four years before landing steady work again, and there is no doubt that took a toll on my self-esteem and self-confidence. I feel like I try really hard to be valuable these days so as to stay employed and not feel that awful feeling again. Maybe that’s part of what is going on? But even before that, I placed a high value on financial security. In fact, if you were to ask me what was most important to me between love, happiness, and financial security, I’d have to go with financial security. Something about that feels wrong to me, but I don’t know what to do about it.",
    "TherapistReply": "That sounds incredibly stressful. You seem to be living in a constant state of worry and anxiety—driven by some vague sense of fear and unease. Sometimes the worries we have without “logical” reason are the hardest to combat. Simply pointing out to you that you are fine isn’t going to add to your sense of security.\n\nSo, what CAN you do? It sounds as if understanding some of the root causes of your need for financial security would be a good place to start. I’d recommend working with a therapist to explore where that need came from. It sounds as if it wasn’t necessarily from childhood deprivation, nor was it caused by your layoff (though that certainly may have intensified the fear and insecurity).\n\nSafety is one of our core needs as humans. That can take many forms: physical safety, emotional safety, and yes, even financial safety. You feel unsafe, and understanding why is likely a good first step in learning how to help you feel safer. My hunch is if those safety needs were attended to, it would allow you to embrace some of those other pieces, like love and happiness. There’s nothing wrong with wanting and needing to feel safe. When we feel unsafe, however, we walk through life in a state of anxious activation, scanning for threats and preparing for the worst. It’s an exhausting, and often unnecessary, burden.\n\nYour sense that no amount of “rainy day” funds would remove your worry indicates that your fear isn’t really about money per se, but more about feeling safe. Understanding the core fear is a place to start."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Teenage Daughter Won’t Listen to Me",
    "Question": "My daughter won’t listen to me! She is 15 and thinks she has everything figured out. She yells at me all the time and says nasty things. I caught her using drugs once, and she’s definitely having sex. She also sneaks out at night sometimes and skips school. This is more than just a rebellious phase. I don’t know where she gets it from, but it’s not me!\n\nI don’t know what to do about it, either. I want to be a good, supportive mom, but I can’t stand by and watch this. I’m really worried about my daughter’s future. She doesn’t seem to care at all. I would appreciate any insights or practical suggestions you have beyond recommending counseling, as there is no way she would go.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for sharing what sounds like a deeply painful, and even frightening, situation. I imagine it is heartbreaking to hear your daughter yell at you and say nasty things. Seeing her engage in risky behaviors that could have serious consequences likely evokes a sense of anxiety and helplessness.\n\nSometimes in situations like this, where you can’t control the behavior of someone else, it is best to shift the focus to the only person you can control: you. It is clear from your writing that this is very difficult for you and you do not know what to do. So, while you can’t force your daughter into counseling, you can certainly go. It sounds like you could benefit from the kind of safe and supportive environment that counseling affords. Beyond support for yourself, once a counselor gains a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play, they might be able to offer to some suggestions for ways to connect with your daughter and help her.I find myself wondering if you have tried approaching her with concern outside of an incident. When you’ve just caught her doing something she is not allowed to do or when you two are in the middle of an argument, neither one of you is in the best place to have a constructive conversation. However, when there’s relative peace in the home, a conversation can go a lot better. I wonder what would happen if, during such a time, you knocked on her door and asked if she had a minute to talk and simply expressed concern. Perhaps you could try something along the lines of, “It doesn’t seem like you’ve been very happy lately and I’m concerned about you. I know we haven’t been getting along very well, either, but I want you to know you can talk to me. I’m here for you.” Even if she doesn’t jump at the opportunity in the moment, perhaps you are planting a seed that might produce fruit down the road.\n\nI’m also curious how long this behavior has been going on. How significant is the change? For example, did she go from being a fairly obedient child who got along well with you to what you have described or was her behavior always difficult to manage? In thinking back to when all of this started, is there any triggering event you can identify—perhaps a change in the family, a significant loss, a move to a different school? Developing some thoughts about what might have prompted this change in her could also be helpful in trying to understand and connect with her.\n\nParenting a teenager who is acting out can be incredibly difficult. I hope you will get the support you need for yourself. You just might find it opens you up to some different approaches to connecting with your daughter. Best wishes on this difficult part of your journey."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Tell My Partner About My Gender Dysphoria?",
    "Question": "I need some friendly feedback with a problem I am stuck with. I am a 60-year-old male who was diagnosed 23 years ago with gender dysphoria. I have just “dealt” with it by staying in the closet, seeing a therapist as needed, and basically choosing not to entertain the idea of transition for family concerns. I am now single again, have met a nice cis woman, and would like to get serious—but I am unsure if I should be totally open about this part of me. I have always been a person of integrity, honest and truthful, which sometimes hurts others but it’s who I am.\n\nWhen I shared this with a woman once before, it ruined a chance for marriage. She was unable to even talk about it and chose to walk away. I never transitioned even partially or lived as the opposite gender. Is it important that I mention this now?\n\nI realize society is more supportive than ever before, but there are still plenty of folks in the world who abhor anything that does not fit into the male-female binary. I have read numerous accounts where other men in a similar situation never said anything, got married, then out of the blue would share this part of them or would start cross-dressing again and naturally the wife was taken by surprise, shocked, and confused. Usually, the marriage ends and everyone is hurt.\n\nI haven’t cross-dressed in 20 years and have no plans to start up again, but this doesn’t ease my fear at what might happen if I come clean with my new partner and prospective wife. What to do?",
    "TherapistReply": "When I first sat down to reply, my inclination was to offer what I hope will be received as comfort: reassurance that you have multiple choices regarding your own communication. You are under no moral obligation to disclose any idea about gender (or anything else) to another person if you don’t want to. Your gender is your truth, and your gender does not make up the entirety of who you are.\n\nBut I imagine you are writing to a therapy website for a reason. If you were okay continuing to do what you’ve already done in relationships (after at least one very powerful, very negative experience disclosing in the past), I don’t think you would have taken the time to construct this letter.\n\nI would like to gently challenge the narrative you have about your disclosure “ruining a chance for marriage,” shifting the blame away from you individually. Was it not your partner’s rigidity about sex and gender that pushed you away? Can we think about this as a paradigm incompatibility rather than a mistake you yourself made?\n\nIn general, if someone is looking for a “serious” relationship (as you say you are now), a critical part of the early stages is getting to know the other person and collecting evidence for whether you will be compatible long-term, is it not? It sounds like some of the anxiety you are experiencing is the normal anxiety of any person in a new relationship—“Will this person turn and run if I share what I really feel inside? Is it safe to trust this person?” Of course, in your case, some of the baggage also carries a gendered focus you have been painfully discouraged from sharing in the past. So far, though, you’ve only alluded to a sharing of ideas, which I hope any partner would remain available for.\n\nI think deconstructing and delineating gender roles is helpful in any relationship, not just in a relationship where one partner is transgender or gender dysphoric. It sounds like you may not decide to “medically” transition in a surgical or hormonal sense, but wouldn’t it be nice to break out of the confines of masculinity as they may be prescribed upon you?\n\nI imagine you have witnessed a great deal of social change regarding gender roles across your lifespan. From this, and from other life experiences, what have you come you expect from yourself, and what do you need in order to feel supported, affirmed, and loved in your relationships? If this includes permission to be fluid and expansive in your expressions of gender, then that is something you are entitled to pursue. If this includes simply the space to air what you’re thinking, free of judgment, that is also completely reasonable. If the relationship is healthy, your partner should not attempt to serve as some sort of mind police for which thoughts are and aren’t okay for you to have and for you to explore. In my experience, our identities, thoughts, and desires are not very good at obediently conforming to socially-sanctioned categories.\n\nWhen I am working with someone who has come to therapy to explore their sense of gender identity, one of my subgoals is to help them seek out affirming community outside of the therapy room. Whether you decide to formally “transition” or not, having folks around who will appreciate your honesty and not force you to adapt to rigid and even false categories will help you feel more liberated in all of your relationships.\n\nYou don’t mention what region you live in, but I will acknowledge that certainly some places are friendlier than others toward those who don’t fit into a simple male-female binary where biological sex and expressed gender align. I also won’t pretend that my own age bracket (I’m 29) isn’t generally more accepting of gender expansion than your generation in many cases. But that doesn’t mean the resources for support and understanding aren’t out there. To find in-person support, PFLAG, a wide-ranging national organization, should be able to connect you to affirming transgender resources within an hour’s travel or so of where you are living if you are living in the States. I’ve also listed some other online communities in the Resources section at the end of this article.the past.\n\nIn 2007, I gave a report on what was then referred to as Gender Identity Disorder, which included a description of the legal entitlements of spouses to recipients of this diagnosis. If individuals were married, spouses used to be required to sign off on a medical decision if their partner was seeking sexual reassignment surgery. Remembering this report has me thinking now: what are the functions of disclosing gender dysphoria to one’s partner? Is it to clear the air, or is it maybe to help them plan for some sort of action? It summons the idea that our identities are most often formed in relation to others, and that to have a partner who challenges gender might mean we challenge our own identities, too. Marriage and intimate partnership can create a sort of collaborative identity formation, but this doesn’t mean you should sacrifice that which is precious to you.\n\nAre you interested in wearing differently-gendered clothing in the presence of your partner or in trying out different kinds of sex other than p-i-v intercourse? These are behaviors of interest to a broad range of people, including those who do not identify as trans. I do not ask these things to suggest that gender dysphoria is the same as having a cross-dressing kink, or is a kink at all. I ask because my ideas about communication on the topic of gender dysphoria are informed by the same kind of openness and honesty I encourage when working with sexual minorities and kinksters.\n\nMy concern for you continuing to maintain the status quo of past relationships is that our unrealized desires so often have a way of breeding resentment if pushed away or neglected for too long, either by ourselves or by our partners. It seems you have more than two decades of experience with this.It is nice to have the freedom to speak difficult and complicated truths within our partnerships. But it’s not just nice: this freedom also forms the foundation of safety and trust. I am admittedly biased; as a relational therapist, I have a strong leaning to encourage others to put all their cards on the table and to keep the lines of communication open. But I’m not alone. For example, in his “sexpert” blog, Reid Mihalko claims that it’s what we’re NOT saying that’s damaging our relationships. He makes the following case for transparency:\n\n“If you share the things you think might end the relationship and the relationship doesn’t end, now you’re having a Relationship with a Capital R! Sure it’s scary to say the scary things, and it’s bound to kick up a lot of emotional flotsam at times, but what if you and your partners could work through it? What if letting the “cat out of the bag” built more trust and a deeper sense of security and intimacy than wondering if your partner is withholding important things from you?\n\nWhen you say what is not being said, especially the big, bad, hairy, scary stuff, you model for your loved ones that they can share all the things they’re not saying, too. Over time, you get to know your partners more as they get to know you more, and you’ll realize that they’re choosing to be in a relationship with the real you, not some façade of who you think they need you to be.”\n\nI will admit that we do not live in a universally gender-progressive utopia, and it is certainly not often safe—emotionally or physically—to disclose our grapplings with traditional gender roles. As an example of complex intersectional identities, Asiel Adan Sanchez shares a complex narrative about how their relationship to a Mexican cultural identity complicates their gender identity narrative and how the traditional notion of coming out can lead to cultural and ethnic erasure. I won’t pretend these categories are simple. I also don’t know your cultural context, your given family history, or how long your previous relationships lasted: certainly these factors can reasonably affect your choices about how you experience and express gender. Since you are the only one who has to live your life, only you can know what decisions are best for your specific context.\n\nYour letter brings to the surface so many ethical quandaries we all wrestle with regarding intimate disclosure! To what extent are our partners entitled to the regulation of our minds and of our bodies? No matter how you answer these questions for yourself and your new relationship, I sincerely hope you find a safe, affirming, and healthy way to explore feelings, roles, and identities—not just in a confidential therapy room or anonymous online forum, but in the safety of romantic partnership as well. I wish you the best!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! How Do You Keep Mutual Friendships Intact After a Breakup?",
    "Question": "My girlfriend and I recently broke up, reluctantly, after two years together. We both felt strongly about remaining close friends, and we talked at length about looking out for each other as we transitioned out of the relationship. For me, in part that meant keeping our circle of mutual friends mutual rather than engaging in a push-pull. It also meant direct communication rather than indirect. I didn’t want either of us to put friends in a position where they felt like they might have to choose or take sides, nor did I want either of us to be surprised by secondhand information that might be hurtful.\n\nUnfortunately, my vision has blown up in my face. She has drawn our support network closer to her, leaving me to make sense of what little filters back to me. This has compounded my sense of loneliness and isolation as I work through mountains of grief and self-doubt.\n\nI get that breakups are hard. I also understand it’s hard to be a friend and to remain neutral when a breakup happens. But what went wrong here? Was it unrealistic to think we might look out for each other? How do couples manage breakups in a way that better honors each other while keeping mutual support networks intact?",
    "TherapistReply": "Hello, and thanks for writing. Boy, talk about best-laid plans, to say nothing of good intentions! Sorry to hear about all the painful turmoil.\n\nFirstly, the questions you pose at the end—good ones, incidentally—lead me to ask some of my own. None of them are meant to blame you for what happened. While we all play a part in relational transactions, I’m less interested in “blame” and more interested in addressing the painful emotional dynamics of the situation. Thus, I wonder:\n\nWhat do you mean you and your girlfriend broke up “reluctantly”? Does this reluctance have anything to do with the aftermath of what happened—i.e., was it more your idea than hers, or vice versa, due to an unspoken or unresolved problem? Perhaps whatever was left unsolved or “hanging” ripened and then spoiled into resentment or whatever is fueling her divisive behavior. Perhaps there were communication issues that translated into acting out or rebellious behavior on her part. Is she blowing off steam with friends she feels “get it” instead of sharing with you? Does she have any reason to believe you can’t or won’t “get it”?\nHow, exactly, is she drawing your support network closer to her? Whatever the answer, it is happening at your expense and needs to stop. You might ask yourself (and her, at some point): is she leveling false charges, exaggerating, or making up negative stories? Is this perhaps due to an unconscious desire to hurt you because she has been hurt? And is her current behavior a pattern with what you’ve observed before—that she acts out feelings she can’t express verbally (such as anger, disappointment, etc.)?\nIs there a way to set the record straight with your friends? Are they shunning you outright? (You may want to address matters with her directly before taking this step, unless you have a dire need to remind your friends that there are two sides at play here.)\nWhen you speak of “self-doubt,” what is it you are doubting? And does this, again, speak of any dynamic that is/was happening in the relationship? Do you tend to criticize or blame yourself for something that happens within the relationship? I was a little surprised you didn’t seem angry at her—more befuddled. Perhaps the anger is directed inward, as if you blame yourself unfairly for something that needs more hashing out between the two of you.\nSometimes couples need to seek couples counseling to, ironically, make an amicable parting. Is that possibly the case here?\nI’m a little concerned about these friends of yours who are drawing toward her without checking in with you. Hey, y’all, how about a little benefit of the doubt? Makes me wonder if these are fair-weather friends or if she’s really that persuasive. Is no one attempting to get your side of the story? If there’s irritation or anger on your part over this, no one could blame you.\nMost pertinently of all: Why not address your concerns directly with her? You mention the goal of direct communication, but I get the impression there is little to no communication between the two of you. How come?\nIt is easy to underestimate the raw power of emotion, especially the so-called darker or “negative” emotions: hurt, anger, resentment, and so forth. (Take a look at our political scene for ample proof.) The problem in the context of a close relationship is that so many of these emotions go unexpressed or remain unconscious, or “unformulated” in the phrasing of psychoanalyst Donnel Stern. It takes relational exchange for such feelings to find formulation and then grounding. Without expression, they can translate into behavior—what we call “enactment” or “acting out.” Perhaps you can encourage her to instead use her words since she may be quite hurt or angry by what happened, has an ax to grind, and is grinding it—unfairly, it sounds like—on you.\n\nI think it would be important for her to explain what is motivating her to act like this, if you feel ready to hear it, and provided she can communicate it to you in a way she owns rather than projecting her feelings (blaming you). If I were you, I might be angry myself that she is so baldly violating the terms you both agreed to regarding the post-breakup plan.\n\nI think it is also important that you tell her you really need her to cut it out—that her behavior is hurtful to you and therefore isolating, since they are, after all, your friends too and she ought not use them as pawns. Is she acting out of anger and trying to hurt you? Because if so, it’s working. What happened to the original agreement?I would encourage both of you to speak of your own feelings rather than blame each other. The old therapy adage about using “I feel …” statements rather than “you’re at fault because …” holds true here. Sharing authentic feelings allows for empathy; blaming provokes defensiveness. I do not sense your intention was to hurt her, but perhaps you unintentionally underestimated the intensity of her feelings or emotional state around the breakup—either because she failed to communicate (no one is a mind-reader) or because you didn’t pick up the cues, or some combination of both. These things happen, but the solution is not to try to hurt the other by putting friends in the middle. This is not the behavior of the “close friend” you each promised to be.\n\nYour description of the “blueprint” for the breakup sounds reasonable, but maybe it was difficult for her to carry out if she held an (unconscious) woundedness. But again, if that is the case, she needs to say it—or at least stop what almost sounds like revenge behavior. Perhaps she merely agreed to “terms” so as not to rock the boat, or felt at the time it was fine—though once the breakup occurred, cold reality set in and her wrath or other intense feelings emerged. Again, all of this is speculative and warrants further exploration with her directly. (She could also be bidding for your attention, to address whatever led to the reluctance of ending things.)\n\nFinally, there really is no blueprint for managing breakups. It is never easy, and there is no right way to do it. It really depends on the personalities and circumstances of those involved.\n\nThus, my suggestion is that you address your most excellent questions to her—or, at the least, should you not want to have such a dialogue, remind her of your agreement and ask her to stop. (The more direct, the better.) I certainly understand your sense of betrayal, which could correspond to what she is also feeling and is expressing (again, perhaps unconsciously) via her behavior. (Behavior itself is a communication.) I strongly recommend you address your feelings about the chaos that is causing so much distress. Because right now she seems to be, sadly, acting almost like an enemy rather than the friend you hoped to have."

    "QuestionTitle": "Performance Anxiety: How Do I Overcome My Fear of Public Speaking?",
    "Question": "I get a lump in my throat just thinking about having to speak in front of groups of people. Well, I had better get over it soon. Next semester I am taking a required public speaking class in which I will regularly have to stand in front of 50 or more people and figure out how to talk coherently. I am terrified and I am positive I will fail. Every time I have to speak in front of people, even if it’s a group of friends and family, my palms get sweaty, I tense up, and I can barely get a word out. And whatever word does come out sounds stupid. I hate the thought of all those eyes and ears trained on me, analyzing my every utterance and expression. Is this what is referred to as performance anxiety?\n\nI don’t understand how some people can be so comfortable speaking in public while others, like me, struggle greatly. I’m much better one-on-one or, better still, saying what I have to say in writing. I know that’s a big reason classes like the one I am taking exist, but is there any hope of actually overcoming a fear of public speaking? Or is the best I can hope for to just get through it without humiliating myself?",
    "TherapistReply": "You write of the terror with which so many are familiar. The thought of getting up in front of a group of people, whether friends or strangers, sends many people into a state of panic. Your body may react in that dreaded way—sweaty palms, flushed face, and tense body—just from anticipating this situation. Thoughts such as, “What if I get choked up and can’t speak?” or, “What if I forget what I am going to say?” may be racing in your mind. Anticipating talking in front of an audience can keep many from facing their fear.\n\nWhile it may be possible for some to avoid public speaking, it may not always possible for others. For example, a mandatory public speaking course leaves you with no other option (aside from course failure) than speaking in front of an audience. As long as you have to do it, you might as well work to overcome your fear of public speaking. This is, in fact, possible.\n\nHere are things to consider:\n\nYou have created a scene in your mind.\n\nYou’ll need to recognize that the scenarios you mentally rehearse about what it will be like to speak in front of an audience are imagined. Certainly, past experiences can help shape and illustrate these scenarios, but fundamentally it is your “what-if” thoughts which are creating the image and triggering the fear.\n\nThoughts are powerful. Also powerful is our ability to better manage thoughts. We have the ability to challenge negative thoughts, thereby creating other scenes in our heads. Similarly, we have the ability to be more aware or more mindful of our thoughts and the role they have in our behavior. We can learn to be better observers of ourselves and accept that while anxiety may come, we do not need to be held captive to it. These shifts may be achieved on your own, but if you would like support in working toward these goals, therapy can be of assistance.The imagined “worst-case scenario” typically does not actually happen.\n\nAnticipated outcomes, when you’re worried, are nearly always worse than the situation that actually plays out. This is important to consider whenever anticipatory worry strikes, but particularly when thinking about everything that could go wrong when speaking in front of a crowd of people.\n\nPreparation is key.\n\nThe best way to set yourself up for success, both for anxiety management and for giving a well-informed and practiced talk, is to prepare. You indicated you are more comfortable expressing yourself in writing. Why not write out your talk exactly the way you want to deliver it if speaking and read that while you practice? Perhaps you can keep this script with you as you deliver the speech, even if just for a sense of security.\n\nRegardless, prepare for whatever you know you can expect (e.g., a time limit, create note cards or presentation slides). Prepare in advance so you don’t inadvertently add in the element of running out of prep time. Once you have your speech completed, practice as much as you feel is helpful. Practice in front of a friend or your stuffed animal. Whatever feels right to you.\n\nThis class may actually end up being life-changing.\n\nPublic speaking can actually feel good, even for those who are fearful of it. Working toward a meaningful goal and subsequently achieving this goal can feel really good. Generally speaking, having success can motivate you to continue to work toward goals in the future. Having success in meeting this goal can also modify your experience of what it means to speak in front of a crowd. Perhaps your next experience with public speaking is not met with the same overpowering fear. It may also be that, down the road, you embrace an invitation to speak in front of a crowd.\n\nThe bottom line is you can do something about this. Allow yourself to be compassionate toward yourself and your fears, recognize thoughts which are not productive, and reset your mind-set to be open to some elements of success. Practice, prepare, and seek outside help if you’d like, too. Good luck!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Have No Interest in Sex",
    "Question": "Dear GoodTherapy.org,\n\nEver since my ex and I broke up a few years ago, my interest in sex has been declining. I have dated a few people since my breakup, but sex just isn’t the same. My libido isn’t what it was, and I just don’t feel “the need” the way I used to. While we were together, my ex and I had a consistently scorching-hot sex life. Sex was extremely important to me and a major source of connection. Now? Most of the time, I can take it or leave it.\n\nPart of me wonders if this is more about getting older and less about something else. I’m 44 now, and I know it’s normal for a man’s libido to decrease over time. But it wasn’t so long ago I was having sex almost daily and it still didn’t feel like enough. The difference is pretty stark, to the point I regularly turn down sexual overtures in the dating world, even when it’s been a week or two. In fact, it’s been a source of discontent in the relationships I’ve tried to develop. I’m not used to being the one to turn down sex.\n\nI don’t feel like attraction is the issue, and I masturbate about as frequently as I ever did. I have to think there is some sort of mental block that is getting in the way of my enjoyment of sex. Maybe my sexual triggers aren’t being triggered enough. Or maybe my needs are evolving and my body is taking the cue. I honestly have no idea, but I miss the old, sexual me.\n\nWhat do you think is going on?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your question. Almost nothing is more personal than our sexuality and associated feelings and desires, so I appreciate your candidness.\n\nAdditionally, few aspects of our human being-ness are more complex than sexuality, so without more background I can only give a hunch as to what I think might be happening. I’ll try to be as honest as you were.\n\nThe short answer to the question “what is going on?” is: quite possibly a lot of things.\n\nI hear what sounds like anxiety in your concern, maybe even an undertow of loss in missing “the old, sexual me.” Could it be you also miss the old sexual relationship? Your feelings of loss seem to sync up with the loss of your ex, which implies this relationship was of profound emotional importance in addition to being “scorching hot.” In fact, the scorching-hot experience is also powerfully emotional: passionate, spontaneous, wild, and playful. Sexuality is such an overwhelming experience because it involves all of us: body, mind, spirit, emotion, intimacy or closeness with another (relationality), and so on; hence its magnetic psychological force.\n\nAs to your specific issue, first I would seek a medical checkup, just to rule out any possible physiological causation.\n\nRuling out medical challenges, I would reflect upon just what it is you lost, in terms of emotional relatedness, when you lost this partner. I would assume, for instance, that they made it “safe” to be yourself, to let intimate aspects of yourself roam free. What made it so, as best you can guess?\n\nAs I read your question a second time, an idea occurs to me. You talk about sex as though it is a free-floating activity, almost as if having a partner is incidental to your sensual pleasure. But the more I study psychology, the more it seems to me that our existence is relational, very much bound with important others. Sigmund Freud himself often hypothesized that masturbation was a way to relieve the sexual attraction to a forbidden or incestuous other—a kind of furtive substitute for sexual longing. (Though it would take Carl Jung to expand the meaning of “connection” or fusion beyond the literal.)\n\nI don’t believe it’s a coincidence that your loss in sex coincides with losing your ex. I’m curious what it is about this other person that created such powerful chemistry between you—and what led to the end of the relationship.It is not unheard of that a couple will have a fiery relationship in the bedroom, but struggle to relate, empathize, or communicate. I’m thinking particularly of romantic experimentation where needs or desires are “sexualized” and satiated physically—nothing wrong with that—while unspoken emotional or psychological differences have yet to be addressed or worked through.\n\nI often work with people who can express a strong, historically unmet need to be seen, valued, and respected only via sex or sexual role play, but not in more mundane daily interaction. In other words, the vulnerability is only physical or literal. Eventually, the relationship deteriorates if the emotional/psychological differences are not addressed. The work of the therapy is, often, in helping a person identify and articulate their needs, often difficult given highly critical or absent parents, though sticking with it often leads to more freedom and options in all of a person’s relational arenas.\n\nAnother way of putting it: sexual satisfaction can temporarily soothe an emotional anxiety or injury unexplored in the relationship, or a sense of frustration or estrangement, leading to only a fleeting sense of connection—which still does not address the relational friction.\n\nThe more I write and think about this, I’m tempted to say what’s happening here may best be described as growing pains. I believe it was the novelist Graham Greene who said that, as we age, companionship becomes more valuable than sex. This often begins to happen slowly as we creep into middle age.\n\nIn that regard, you sound right on schedule, though I know it can be unsettling, and even trigger feelings of grief and loss, if solitary sexual activity has been of consolation to you. Your current dilemma, then, could be facing a newfound vulnerability after losing a person who co-created a highly exciting chemistry. It is often the case we desire to share our existence with another more strongly than is consciously believed, whether it be primarily sexual or platonic or somewhere in between. This is often an uncomfortable or even painful adjustment—but not indicative of anything wrong with you. In fact, quite the contrary.\n\nFor men especially (though this certainly can apply to women, too), sexuality can come to represent, symbolize, or have personal meaning in many ways: as a means of finding freedom, fulfillment, and validation or a sense of being strongly valued and desired. The magical feeling of sex or romance can arise when we sense that our very being is desired by another, that this deep, profound desire is in sync with another’s desire for us.\n\nThis connection can feel transformative. It can loosen the grip of existential alienation or isolation so many of us struggle with, in an era of mostly technological connection. Some of the people I work with in therapy report feeling most “horny” or sexually hungry during or just after a period of grief.\n\nIs it possible the situation is also difficult because your main means of consolation (sexuality, masturbation) is elusive, or less effective, in the aftermath of the breakup? That can be an unsettling realization, indeed, though by no means hopeless.\n\nAs we get older, we hopefully discover there is more to partnership than just the physical mechanics or hydraulics of sex. It sounds like you could really be yourself with this person, that you could both reciprocate and find exciting similarity of passion in the bedroom; what, I wonder, prevented this from happening outside the bedroom as well?\n\nIn other words, it sounds like you made a profound emotional/relational connection, which you deeply miss. One plus one equals three, meaning two people in deep connection create a third element: the relationship itself, in all of its maddening glory. You found unique chemistry with this person. How could it be the same on your own?\n\nYou could, if the relationship is irreparably over, ask yourself what qualities of this person you found so attractive, what it is that made them so special, especially in bed? What didn’t happen in the overall relationship that prevented it from continuing; can you look without heavy self-criticism at your participation here, your 50%, and see if anything can change to attract or keep the next person you’ll hopefully meet?\n\nPerhaps the answer to the latter is emotional closeness, companionship, or friendship—and some deeper self-understanding, maybe even via counseling or therapy.\n\nI can understand your painful sense of loss, bewilderment, anxiety, and even frustration at the dilemma you describe so honestly. At the same time, there is a chance to “make lemonade” by finding or seeking the succor of deeper human connection and self-awareness, with a new partner and/or others who can relate or identify with what you’re going through. It sounds like a kind of (pardon the cliché) midlife crisis, and this is not uncommon in the slightest."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Do People Say, ‘I Know How You Feel’? They Don’t!",
    "Question": "After I suddenly lost my husband to an accident last month, I attended a few grief support group meetings at the urging of my sister, who thought it might be beneficial for me to be around other people who had “experienced loss.” Although I didn’t feel ready (and still don’t), I agreed. Now I regret it. The other people in the group are also grieving, but their circumstances are different than mine. One lost her husband to cancer over a period of years. At least they were able to get everything in order and say goodbye to each other! One man in his 90s lost his life partner of the same age. At least they had 60-plus years together and the death wasn’t unexpected! One woman lost her damn dog! I love dogs, but she was in the wrong room, as far as I’m concerned.\n\nAnd all of them wanted to tell me they knew what I was going through. “I know how you feel,” the elderly man said to me more than once. No, you don’t! You cannot possibly understand how I felt losing my husband at age 37 less than an hour after we talked on the phone about having chicken and pineapple shish kebabs that evening. We had our whole lives ahead of us. Your whole lives were behind you.\n\nI know these people mean well and are just trying to comfort me, but when apples were being compared to oranges, all I could feel was anger and resentment. Find me a support group for 34-year-old widows whose 37-year-old husbands fell off a ladder and hit their heads while trying to clean their mother-in-law’s gutters, leaving behind three children and unknown potential, and then we’ll talk. Failing that, don’t tell me you know how I feel because you don’t. Why is that so hard?",
    "TherapistReply": "You have identified a common frustrating part of experiencing grief—platitudes from well-wishers who actually make things harder rather than easier. Nobody knows what you feel—not even a group of 34-year-old widows who lost their husbands in tragic accidents. Nobody. Your experience of grief is shaped entirely by your circumstances, experiences, and the way you make meaning of events in your life.\n\nWhile your sister’s impulse was good—find connections with people who “get it”—it sounds like that wasn’t what you needed at the time. My recommendation would be to find someone you can work with on your own so you can express your anger, frustration, sadness, loss, and rage against the events that took your partner from you.\n\nThere may be a time when you are in a different place in your grieving process that a group might be helpful for you, but now is clearly not the time. Hearing other people’s stories of loss isn’t making you feel connected; it’s making you feel more isolated. That is not what you need right now.And while nobody can know what you are feeling, there are some aspects to grieving that seem to be shared across many experiences. First, there is no single right way to grieve and there is no timeline. You will, over time, feel less raw, but grief is not a process you complete and move on from. It transforms you. And even when you have worked through the expected stages—denial, bargaining, anger, sadness, acceptance—something will likely show up that throws you right back into the mix again. Some of it is predictable—birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, Father’s Day—but some may happen on a random Thursday when a song, a smell, an article of clothing will transport you back, for a brief moment, to the gut punch that is loss.\n\nAnd while I can’t offer any words of consolation—for there are no adequate words—know that what you experience is yours, and that you can heal. One of the paths of healing, however, lies in connecting with others—hence your sister’s suggestion of a support group. Nobody knows your experience of your particular loss, yet there are people who do share your experience of feeling alone in their grief with nobody who understands. Maybe you can connect on that level. You also have three small people who are sharing in your grief in their own ways. If you haven’t already connected them with resources, please do. It may also be helpful to get support for you all together—through a family counselor, perhaps—to help you grieve together as you grieve independently.\n\nYou asked why it is so hard for people to understand how unhelpful their “helpful” words actually are—and in part it is because caring people want to help, want to connect, and want to make things better. Unfortunately, we don’t always know how to do so. There are no adequate words, so we stumble for them. We are often profoundly uncomfortable with witnessing the distress of others, so we try to make it okay. Your loss is not okay. But you will be. Find the people who can just sit with you without needing you to be any way other than you are in that moment. Rage, cry, laugh, reminisce, do what you need to do, and then find the things that bring you hope, that help you feel connected and not so very much on your own."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Are We Here? Can Therapy Help Me Understand the Meaning of Life?",
    "Question": "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about some heavy questions. What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? What’s out there? Millions of sperm and I win the race? Why me? Why you? What’s so special about me? What’s so special about you?\n\nI am not a spiritual or religious person. I believe in science and evolution. It’s fascinating to me to look up at the stars and realize the ones I can see represent an incredibly tiny fraction of the number of stars in a universe believed to contain trillions of galaxies. Anyone with even a modest appreciation of mathematics would conclude we cannot possibly be alone. There has to be life, abundant life, elsewhere. What is its purpose? While we’re at it, just for fun, what is space as we know it contained in? What’s beyond space?\n\nI’m not high, I promise. To be fair, I ask these questions fully understanding you cannot answer them. No one can. But the human mind—my mind, at least—seeks answers. My mind is both fascinated and troubled by what it will never know. I guess that’s why I’m writing. What I do know is that therapy purports to help people learn to live with seemingly unanswerable questions. Am I an exceptional case? Do people come to therapy seeking peace with life’s most perplexing questions? Or is the goal of therapy to help people like me deal with/accept not knowing? I’m curious how therapists go about helping people whose concerns go far, far beyond relationship issues, self-loathing, or specific mental health conditions. It’s what I don’t know that is killing me.",
    "TherapistReply": "I love this question and I am so glad you wrote in with it. Existential psychology is a specialty area within the field of psychology that addresses the discomfort people feel as they grapple with some of life’s unanswerable questions. This part of the field does not get much attention in the mainstream, but it is so very rich. It sounds like you might really benefit from working with a therapist who has expertise in this area.\n\nEngaging in existential psychotherapy would provide you with a forum to explore these issues and their meaning to you. Developing an understanding of why these issues trouble you and what they trigger in you would likely be a key part of the process. The aforementioned whys are in many cases actually answerable, and answering them would likely lead you to a deeper understanding of yourself. This can feel quite empowering and clarifying in ways that can be life-changing. It might even make the unanswerable questions less troubling to you. Further, doing so within the context of a therapeutic relationship would enable you to feel safe and secure; therefore, you might not feel the need to preface your concerns with, “I’m not high, I promise.”Some mental health professionals who specialize in existential psychotherapy have a background in spirituality and may approach your questions from a position of faith, but many come from a place of understanding what we do know and how we can learn and grow from the knowledge within us. If a therapist’s approach or belief system might be of concern to you, you could always speak with the therapist ahead of time to see where they stand. Finding a good fit for your specific needs is important.\n\nIn addition to the discomfort you express as you grapple with these issues, I also hear a genuine intellectual curiosity. With that in mind, I wonder if you would also benefit from taking some academic courses, attending lectures, or reading books and articles in fields such as existential psychology, existential philosophy, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.\n\nWhatever course of action you choose, I encourage you to approach the journey with openness, curiosity, and a great deal of compassion and patience for yourself. I hope your journey leads you to a place of understanding, but most of all, to a place of peace."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Wife Doesn’t Love Me Anymore and Says She Needs ‘Space’",
    "Question": "I’ve been married for nine years and have two children. This past month, my wife told me that she no longer loves me and she needs space. I was diagnosed with depression a year ago and she says the episode changed me and I am no longer the person she married. She now wants time to “find herself” and to try and “discover her love” again.\n\nSince letting me know about how she feels, she has become very distant and spends most of her time reading books or giving her attention to friends. She also refuses to talk about the situation; she says that just makes things worse and will push her further away. She says she will chat to me when she is ready.\n\nI’m really not sure what to do. I feel completely unloved and stuck in a situation where I’m with someone who doesn’t want to be with me. While I’m trying to be supportive to her, it also hurts to know I’m with someone who doesn’t love me anymore. I still love her deeply.",
    "TherapistReply": "How very painful it must have been to hear your wife say those words to you. It is not unusual for feelings to ebb and flow over the course of a relationship, but hearing a partner say they no longer love you is hurtful. On the one hand, it sounds like your wife wants to “discover” her love again—meaning she has not closed the door on the possibility your love can be rekindled. She may be on a journey of her own and may need time and space to get there. However, it is difficult to rediscover love in a vacuum. It sounds as if you feel as if you are in the dark about what your wife wants or needs and what a reasonable timeline might be, which is a frustrating and scary place to be.\n\nIt also sounds as if you feel her withdrawing from you and your relationship, which also can be painful. You may be ready to engage, but she is not. When you experienced your depression, I wonder if you experienced a similar need to withdraw from the relationship. Is there anything in your experience of the past year that can help you understand what she is experiencing?While she may not be ready to talk about the situation, it is reasonable to ask for some parameters. You can’t rush another’s process, but you can discuss a timeline for check-ins. This doesn’t mean requiring big answers of one another, but there needs to be a way for the two of you to share information so you both can make good decisions. One of those decisions may be to not stay “stuck” in a situation where you feel unloved. Your relationship needs to work for the two of you, and if your needs are not being met, and especially if you are feeling more and more hurt and isolated, it’s fair to consider whether staying in the relationship makes sense for you.\n\nThere is much to sort out for each of you individually and both of you together. My recommendation would be for each of you to work with an individual counselor to clarify your needs and what you are able to offer one another, and, if your wife is willing, to work with a couples counselor who can help the two of you decide how to be in relationship together.\n\nI have known couples who needed to take a break from one another in order to find ways to reconnect. For some, that meant separating for a time while working in counseling together. Others found ways to do so without physically separating, but by establishing clear guidelines for how to be together during a transitional time. No matter the path you choose, it will require both of you to engage in conversations about how to move through this process, particularly as parents of young children. The way the two of you communicate and navigate this uncertain time will have an impact on how you are able to parent together. Finding ways to parent effectively together may provide opportunities to reconnect as a team and rediscover one another as partners. Opening lines of communication without pressuring one another to have answers is an important step to take, and one that may need the support of a professional."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Partner Doesn’t Seem to Like My Child",
    "Question": "I am a mother of one child, and I share custody of that child with her father. I’ve been divorced for seven years, and for the last two I’ve been seeing someone I’ve become really close to. We’ve lately been discussing getting a place together, but there’s one thing that’s been bothering me—he doesn’t seem to like my child. He’s not mean, short, or even rude. He just doesn’t engage her, doesn’t talk to her much, and doesn’t seek out interactions with her. In fact, it’s like he’d rather pretend she isn’t there, unless he has to do otherwise. He prefers to go out and take trips when my daughter is with her father, even though I’ve said frequently that I’d like to include her in the future, at least some of the time.\n\nMy daughter is 8 and reasonably well-behaved, well-mannered, energetic but not too wild—in short, she’s a typical kid and acts like one. There are no underlying factors of health or behavior that might complicate the situation, and she really seems to like my boyfriend and though she hasn’t yet seemed to notice that he often brushes her off, I’m worried she’ll begin to and be hurt by it.\n\nI’ve tried to talk to him about this, but he says he likes her just fine, it’s just that he doesn’t know how to talk to kids. It was a relief to hear that the first time, and I said he could talk to her about anything—a show she likes, the book she’s reading, or her friends at school, etc. But the next time they were around each other, nothing changed. This has become a pattern, and so I’ve mostly stopped bringing it up.\n\nI haven’t dated much since my divorce, so I don’t have anything to compare this to. Is this normal? Should this be a deal-breaker? How can I find out what’s really going on, and whether it’s something that can change?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for sharing what sounds like a deeply complex dilemma. Dating when you have a child is so very hard because you are ideally looking for two connections—one between you and your partner and another between your partner and your child. It sounds like you have one of those connections, but not the other, and you’re trying to decide where to go from here.\n\nI find myself feeling curious if you’ve talked to your daughter about how she feels about your partner. If you haven’t, it seems like it might be time. Invite her to be honest, and ask simple questions. Does she like him? How does she feel when she spends time with him? Is there anything she doesn’t like about him? What does she wish was different about him? Keep the questions directed at her experience of him; do not ask her to weigh in on your decisions about the relationship—that’s too much responsibility for a child to take on. After such a conversation, you may have a better understanding of her experience of him.Even with an understanding of how she feels about your partner, it’s important to remember you are the parent and you are responsible for making the best decisions for your daughter. For example, if the conversation with her validates your belief she is unaware that she is being brushed off, this doesn’t mean she will remain unaware. You indicate a concern she will notice and it will hurt her. I think that is a valid concern. As she grows, she will almost certainly realize his disinterest in her, which may be hurtful in the moment but may also send a message to her about what she should expect in her own relationships.\n\nYou ask how you can find out “what’s really going on” and if it can change. This can only be addressed with him. It sounds like you haven’t seen any change in his behavior with your daughter and the conversation between you and him is so unproductive that you have ceased having it. Perhaps it’s time to consider enlisting the support of a couples therapist. If both of you are willing, a therapist can help you to move beyond this impasse and have a more productive conversation.\n\nIf he is unwilling to engage in therapy with you, it might be a good idea to engage in your own therapy. This is gut-wrenching. You’ve found a relationship you feel happy in after your divorce but question—with good reason—what the impact might be for your daughter. There are no easy answers here, and having the support of a therapist could be helpful as you try to set a course for your future."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Get My Family to Stop Pressuring Me to Get Married?",
    "Question": "How can I make my family understand that I’m not ready for marriage yet? For most of my life, I have been told by my parents (mostly my mom) to stay away from boys and to focus on my schoolwork and landing a good job. Now that I’m older, my mom comes out of the blue and starts lecturing me on finding a boyfriend, getting married, and having kids. I’m comfortable being on my own right now.",
    "TherapistReply": "Parents are like that—mothers especially. They know what they want for their daughters, so they tell them how to get it and nag them until they do. It’s fine for your mother to have ambitions and ideas as they relate to you, but it is not okay for her to push them on you. She wants you to want what she wants for you—not what you want for you.\n\nYou don’t say whether you fulfilled your mother’s expectations to “stay away from boys” and focus on schoolwork and getting a good job. Parenting directives of that nature come from a good place and may be appropriate when you’re a teenager. You don’t say how old you are now, but I gather you’re not a teenager anymore. And while your mom may still mean well, only your internal directives matter now.\n\nIn your mother’s eyes, getting married and having kids is the next step. Perhaps you will want those things in the future, perhaps not. The bottom line is you’re not there. You are not ready to get married and have kids and you are self-aware enough to know that. So stick to your guns. Now is the time to explore who you are now and to pursue the life you envision for yourself now.But what can you do about your mother? How can you make her stop? I’d start by suggesting you tell her to back off, but I have the feeling you’ve done that and it hasn’t worked. You can’t change her and make her stop talking about what she wants you to do, just as she can’t change you and make you do what she wants. But you can change how you respond to her.\n\nYou might try a karate master’s technique and let your mother’s energy just whiz by you. Summon your internal energy or resolve. Focus on your strength and feel your power. Let your mother’s words flow past you. Focus on your breath, stay centered, and let her words go by.\n\nMy grandmother used to say to me, “I’m going to tell you something. Promise you won’t get mad.” I would promise, then listen to what she had to say and get mad anyway. This went on for years, until I learned to say, “If you know I’m going to get mad at you, why do you say it?” After a time, she stopped handing out her free advice and we got along much better.You might take a similar approach, but one that could prove effective right away: keep your response centered on your feelings about the behavior, not the behavior itself. Use “I” statements, not “you” statements, as the latter tend to elicit defensiveness when the goal is empathy and understanding. When your mother throws out a line with the hook, “When are you going to find a nice boy and settle down and get married?” you can refuse to bite and tell her succinctly, “I know those words come from a place of concern for me, but I have made my position on this clear. It hurts me when my feelings are ignored. It makes me feel like I can’t be who I am.” See if that makes a difference. If she continues to press and you continue to feel burdened by her expectations, you might consult a therapist in your area who can help you learn strategies for coping with the distress your mother’s words are causing you. Again, you can’t change your mom, but you can change how she affects you.\n\nLearning to advocate for yourself, to not take the bait, isn’t easy. But you may find it an enormously helpful life skill that comes in handy more times than you can imagine, and in a great variety of situations. Just because someone invites you to an argument doesn’t mean you have to go."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Partner Insists on Checking My Phone Messages",
    "Question": "I have been with my boyfriend for going on three years. A couple of months ago, he said he thought it would be “healthy” for us to be able to have access to each other’s phones. He wants to be able to read my text messages whenever he wants and says he’s okay with me reading his too.\n\nI thought this request was odd, to say the least. I told a couple of friends about it and they also said it was weird. Neither one has an “open phone” policy with their partners. They think it speaks to trust issues on his part.\n\nWe don’t have a history of infidelity, so that can’t be it. I’ve never betrayed him in any real sense. The only thing I can even think of that created any sort of weirdness in our relationship was when I got hit on at a friend’s wedding. That was about six months ago, and while I did accept a friend request from the guy on Facebook, we have only exchanged a couple of comments on public posts. Friendly, but nothing racy. My boyfriend mentioned our interactions once but not in a way that would suggest he felt threatened or insecure. Anyway, I asked him if that had anything to do with his request and he said no.\n\nSo I’m not sure what’s going on, but I don’t like knowing my boyfriend insists on seeing my messages. To avoid giving him cause for alarm, I told him I’m fine sharing. We keep our phones unlocked now and he is free to look at mine whenever he wants. Though I’ve never witnessed him doing it, I know he does. I have never looked at his. I just don’t feel a need.\n\nWhat do you think is happening here? Am I going about this the right way? Should I insist on a boundary?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for writing in. I, too, have some concerns about this “open phone” policy and understand your reluctance, which I encourage you to pay more attention to. Before expounding, however, I’m going to briefly discuss what, exactly, a “boundary” is, in my clinical experience, since the term gets thrown around a lot while meanings differ.\n\nSince I like to work from a point of view I call “emotional mindfulness”—and what are love and intimacy if not emotion-based experiences?—I think of a boundary as an inflection point beyond which one will suffer in an unacceptable way. This point of departure most often concerns a specific behavior which causes a person a level of distress or suffering they are not able or willing to tolerate.\n\nIt is, in other words, a way of warding off a negative emotional experience, which is why it’s so important such things be discussed in a relationship with as open a mind and heart as possible—even or especially when they don’t “make sense” or conflict with our own way of viewing things. Concrete statements can be debated, while feelings remain indisputably personal: “here is how someone ought to behave in a situation” versus “this is what upsets or hurts or feels positive about this.”\n\nMy sense is you and your boyfriend are somehow missing each other in this regard. On the one hand, you say, “To avoid giving him cause for alarm, I told him I’m fine sharing [phones].” Thus, after some internal deliberation and perhaps anxiety, you agreed with his request—except you are writing to me about it, indicating there remains some anxiety or reservation.\n\nThe concern I have here is that the focus has become centered on the mechanics rather than the emotional meaning of this sharing. By “meaning,” I refer to how you both think and feel about what’s happening and how it impacts the relationship. In a way, the background dilemma has been tabled, not solved.\n\nThe fact a guy hit on you at a wedding became understandably concerning for your boyfriend; this guy then “friended” you on Facebook, which you accepted. While your trusting of others isn’t a bad thing unto itself, I would hope you can see how that might have been anxious-making for your partner, perhaps due to some of his own history (just as some of yours may have impacted your decision to friend the guy and/or agree to share phones).\n\nIn all fairness, your boyfriend did not come out and discuss his concerns explicitly, which is part of the “missing each other” I mention above. He took a literal or physical approach rather than risking vulnerability in discussing it. You may have taken a similar route in agreeing to share your phone when you were hesitant, both of you bypassing the emotional risk or vulnerability so crucial to building closeness or intimacy.Your decision to friend this fellow—and here I’m reaching a bit—could mean you do not like to feel constrained, for example in who you do or don’t befriend or interact with. You might believe, “I told him I’m taken, he gets it, and I’m fine with it.” Of course, your boyfriend could harbor similar sentiment about checking your phone: “I’m not suspicious of anything in particular, it’s just a way of shoring up trust and makes me feel better.” It sounds like both of you are facing common human anxieties that might, if mutually shared and understood, lead to deeper understanding and a strengthened emotional bond.\n\nThe “I’m” and “me” parts are key. It’s hard to put the “we” above “me” in any relationship, especially when we don’t get the other person’s point of view (more on that in a second), or if that POV conflicts with or appears to get in the way of our autonomy, freedom, and so forth.\n\nI find generally that all behavior, especially when it concerns a close relationship, is a kind of communication, sometimes revealing intention that may or may not be conscious. On some level, your boyfriend’s impulse to check your phone—which will require checking and rechecking because it doesn’t address the underlying emotional problem, another reason it’s only a Band-Aid solution—is a way of saying, “I don’t trust you.”\n\nIt could also be saying, “I do trust you, but I get so anxious about this that I must have validation or confirmation. It’s hard to say no to this need to know.”\n\nYour deciding to friend the guy at the wedding is a way of saying, “Hey, you can trust me, I’m loyal to you.” It could also be a matter of “I have a hard time saying ‘no’ as it might hurt the other person’s feelings, so it’s safer to just agree.”\n\nBoth of you overlap in saying, “Please understand this, don’t be hurt”—agreeing with the other’s behavior in a way that misses the underlying, more vulnerable anxieties or hopes for understanding. Thus, the relationship remains anxiety-laden, which is probably why you decided to write in.\n\nIn either case, you and your boyfriend have real (and understandably human) vulnerabilities around trust and betrayal. It’s worth sitting down with each other for an open conversation in which you try to hear the other person out in terms of their hopes and fears. If this feels uncomfortable, reach out to a therapist who can help facilitate things in an impartial way.\n\nPerhaps your boyfriend was once betrayed by a partner, leading to anxiety around a repetition of this; perhaps you once said no to someone and it backfired or hurt you. In either event, I would think the solution has to come from within each of you in a shared way, rather than a physical or concrete way of controlling anxiety and postponing some stepping-outside-the-comfort-zone. We cannot avoid the need to emotionally stretch—sometimes awkwardly, uncomfortably—in the growth required for long-term intimacy.\n\nI see this in couples counseling all the time, where one person needs to turn up the volume on their wants or needs (yourself, in this case), while the other needs to dial it down a bit in terms of intrusiveness or demand (your boyfriend)—while both partners attempt to center on the emotional vulnerabilities driving the conflict, rather than resting in an external solution. Putting the cart before the horse is something we all do, though the “horse” (i.e., the relationship) only ends up feeling blocked, restless, or cagey."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is It Abuse When My Partner Calls Me Names?",
    "Question": "I don’t think my relationship with my boyfriend is that bad, but some of my friends beg to differ. Mainly, they are concerned about some of the language he uses with me. He can be crass at times, for sure, but I don’t think he usually means to make me feel bad. I tend to look at it like he’s just “being a guy” since it’s how I hear guys talking to each other sometimes. Maybe he just looks at me as “one of the guys” and it’s a comfort thing?\n\nFor as long as we’ve been together (going on two years now), he has called me “b—-,” “c—,” and “w—-” pretty often. Like, at least one of those at least once a day, and usually way more. Sometimes he says these things when I make him mad, but more often than not it’s like he uses these terms in place of my real name, almost like a playful nickname? I have asked him once or twice why he does it and he says I shouldn’t overthink it and they’re just “terms of endearment.”\n\nObviously, I’m used to it after all this time, but whenever he does this when my friends are around they gasp or come to my defense. Privately, a couple of friends have told me my boyfriend is being emotionally abusive when he calls me names, and that I should not tolerate it. I made the mistake of telling my boyfriend that my friends considered what he was doing emotional abuse, and he just got defensive and actually did it more, as if to make a point. I don’t see him stopping. I can’t decide if it bothers me (or should bother me) or not. Do you think I am being abused? I don’t want to leave him since I don’t feel all that unhappy in general, but I also hate to think I am in an abusive relationship!",
    "TherapistReply": "The only people who can really evaluate how a relationship is working are the people who are in the relationship.\n\nThat said, the behaviors you are describing would naturally raise concerns with those who care about you. The words he is using, especially “c—” and “w—-,” are aggressive words that are generally considered pretty disrespectful. The fact he uses these words when he is angry is a red flag. As far as terms of endearment go, they aren’t very endearing. You are not “one of the guys”—you are his partner. There is a difference.\n\nThe true indicator, however, is how he would respond if you did ask him to stop. If you decided you did not want to be called those names, even affectionately or playfully, would he respect your wishes or would he dismiss them? Telling you not to “overthink” things seems pretty dismissive. Your attempt to raise the issue about your friends’ feelings seemed to increase rather than decrease the behavior. That is not a sign of someone who is willing to take in alternative perspectives or be sensitive to the needs and feelings of others. Those are warning signs to pay attention to.You do not have to be bothered by words if they don’t bother you. You don’t have to be bothered by words because your friends are bothered. It is important, however, to pay attention to how your boyfriend handles conflict and responds to your feelings. Is he willing to adjust his habits if they are hurtful to you? If not, then your friends have reason to be concerned.\n\nGenerally, how we speak to people is a reflection of how we think of them and usually a strong predictor of how we treat them. Using dismissive, disrespectful, or derogatory language tends to distance us from the humanity of the other person and allows us to ignore their feelings and needs. This may not happen intentionally, but it is often a side effect of that kind of practice.\n\nOnly you can decide if your relationship is working for you. I would encourage you, however, to think beyond the words and explore how your needs are being met in the relationship and how you feel when you are with this person. Do you feel cared for, loved, and respected? Do you feel your needs are valued and attended to? Do you feel like he is your number one fan and will support you through tough times? Does he help build you up when you are feeling low? Do you feel good about yourself when you are with him?\n\nIf the answer to these questions is no, then language is not the biggest issue in your relationship. And if that’s the case, you may want to speak with a qualified therapist who can help you sort through your feelings and your options."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Don’t Like Kids. I Don’t Want Kids. What’s Wrong with Me?",
    "Question": "Everyone I know goes bonkers when they see a kid under the age of, say, 6. “Oh, what a sweet-faced little angel!” they’ll say. All I see, meanwhile, is a snot-nosed germ factory and life/financial drain whose parents, in the prime of their lives, surrendered their freedom to raise.\n\nI never say this out loud, of course. But sometimes my dislike of kids inevitably comes out, as when the unwanted questions about my own situation come along: “Any kids?” “Don’t you want to have children?” “When are you having kids?” Nope. I sure don’t. Never! People stare at me like I have three heads when I say I don’t like or want kids.\n\nI’m getting to the age where most of my friends are having kids, and this makes me feel increasingly isolated. I can’t help that I don’t like kids (at least, I don’t think I can?), but I also sometimes find myself wondering if there’s something wrong with me for not liking/wanting children. Your thoughts on this would be welcomed.",
    "TherapistReply": "I really appreciate this question. So many people struggle with this issue. Having children, like any other life decision, is not for everyone. Some people are certain they want to have children, others are certain they don’t want to have children, and still others are unsure. It sounds like you fall squarely in the category of being certain you do not want to have children. There is nothing wrong with you for making this decision.\n\nSociety seems to be at something of turning point on this issue. People of previous generations often got married and had children without giving it much thought, but rather because it was just “what you did.” These days, for many people, major life events—including marriage and having children—are not taken for granted, but rather thoughtful decisions based on the kind of lives they’d like to live. Still, there remain plenty of people who see these events as customary, desirable, traditional, or inevitable and therefore have no qualms about asking you when you are going to do them.I would imagine if you can do some work to get to a place where you accept this as a valid choice designed to give you the kind of life you are seeking, you may stop questioning what is “wrong” with you. You may feel more comfortable providing people with explanations when they inquire or, even better, you won’t feel a need to justify your choices. If you struggle to get to this place on your own, you might consider partnering with a therapist to help you explore this issue, come to terms with it, and decide how (or if) you want to talk about it with people.\n\nBefore closing, I’d like to end on a practical note. You mention feeling isolated as more and more of your friends begin to have children. People generally become friends with one another because of some commonalities or an experience that draws them together. This was probably the case for you and your friends when you met. As your friends move into parenthood, there can still be a place for you in their lives (and vice versa), but it may also be important for you to find some friends who are interested in the freedom a child-free life can provide."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Try to Find My Biological Parents?",
    "Question": "My biological parents gave me up for adoption when I was born. I’m sure they had their reasons, and I am probably better for it since I grew up in a very loving family and turned out as well as could be expected. I’ve never wanted for anything. I have a great life, a great career, and a great family of my own now. I’m 45 years old. I don’t feel traumatized. I’m actually relieved my birth parents made the decision they did. I’ve never asked my adoptive parents about them.\n\nAs I have gotten older, though, I have had more and more thoughts about my biological parents. I find myself wondering about the circumstances that led them to give me up, whether they’re still alive, and if so, what they’re like today. I wonder if they think of me, too. And I wonder what it would be like to meet them. I had never felt compelled to go down this road until recently, so I’m not sure what’s bringing these feelings to the surface.\n\nI guess I just don’t know if it’s wise, from the standpoint of my mental health, to pursue this. Like I said, my life is great without them in it. Also, while I wonder if my life could be enhanced by knowing more about the people who gave me life and connecting with them after all these years, I am mindful of the possibility I will only learn upsetting things. Who knows? Maybe they wouldn’t even want anything to do with me.",
    "TherapistReply": "It is only natural you would wonder about who your birth parents are, what they’re like, and why they decided to put you up for adoption. Who wouldn’t be curious? You write that your life, career, and family are satisfying, and perhaps you’d like them to know that. Maybe you also wonder what your life would have been like if you hadn’t been adopted. These days, there are numerous ways to look for people that may help you find your birth family—if you decide you want to.\n\nMany years ago, adoption information was not recorded or, if it was, the records were closed, but since 1980 most adoptive records are open. If you decide to look for more information, you can use social media, genealogy websites, and open records that should give you access to your birth certificate and other information. I personally know one person who found her birth mother on Facebook.\n\nYou wonder what it might be like to meet your family of origin. Different people have different experiences, of course. You might find out you have siblings, for example. You might feel you have little in common with your birth family or, on the contrary, there is a lot you share. There is only one way to know the answer, but would the answer be worth the time and emotional energy you expend?\n\nYou are worried about how this would affect your mental health. That is a good question, and I suggest this is such a big question that you might want to work with a therapist or professional adoption adviser who could accompany you on your journey. You would be hunting down the past and bringing it into the present. Working out whether you really want to do that, and then how to proceed if you do, may be no simple task. Finding your birth parents and meeting them would likely necessitate a big adjustment on everyone’s part.I don’t know if you ever watched the TV show This Is Us. It has many threads, but one of the important plot lines concerns looking for and finding a birth parent. You might want to watch the show and see what it brings up for you. Chances are, you have plenty of your own fodder.\n\nI wonder if you know other people who have been adopted. If so, you might like to discuss your feelings with them and get to know how they understand their adoption. Talking to your partner is important, too.\n\nIt sounds like you never discussed this with your adoptive family. It may feel like a delicate issue to bring up, but they could be enormously helpful in your search and may even feel it is important for all of you.\n\nYou may fear rejection. Many people do. You birth family may have the same fears about you, and you might also reject your birth family once you meet them; there’s no way to know. Your adoptive family could fear losing you. This delicate decision to find your birth parents requires a combination of wisdom and courage.\n\nEither decision—to know or not to know—is wise and brave. Only you can decide what is the right path for you. Whatever you choose, I admire your curiosity and your process. You are not taking this lightly, nor should you.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you check back in and let me know what happens."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Can’t Stop Worrying About Getting Sick",
    "Question": "I’m a 27-year-old dental student with no serious medical issues other than sports injuries. Over the past few years, I have developed these thoughts about getting/being sick. I am constantly paying attention to my body. Any little thing I notice, I freak out. I am frequently going to the doctor for one thing after another and can’t seem to control my brain immediately thinking the worst. And every time I go, I am perfectly healthy.\n\nI also think that because I am believing in these fake ailments, it’s causing my brain to create symptoms! It’s frustrating because I don’t know how to stop feeling like this even though I know it’s mostly in my head. At this point, my girlfriend and family are getting sick of me asking things like “This isn’t cancer, right?” or “I’m going to be okay, right? It’s not going to kill me or anything?”\n\nMy main question is why am I always thinking of the worst-case scenario with my health? Why can’t I just have a sore throat and think “I must have a cold” instead of “I must have a rare infection that’s going to eventually kill me”? Any help would be awesome because as of now I feel myself worrying about being sick more than actually enjoying my life. Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "You’ve asked a great question, and you are not alone in asking it: Why do you seem to always think of the worst-case scenario when it comes to your health, and what can you do differently so you are not immediately thinking the worst? The answer to this question is very much tied to understanding what may be behind this in the first place.\n\nHow you describe your concerns is consistent with what is conceptualized in the DSM-5 (the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) as illness anxiety, as well as what prior to this would have been considered hypochondriasis (debilitating worry about having a serious illness). Regardless, please know there are things you can do to keep the worry from getting the better of you.\n\nIt’s worth stating this about anxiety more generally: some people are more prone to either anxiety or hypervigilance (heightened awareness about small sensations or possible threats, in this case health-related symptoms) than others. This can happen for any number of reasons, and it’s okay if you tend to be that way. What you are doing, essentially, is making sense of your experiences and protecting yourself from perceived threats of danger. While this can be adaptive—as doing so can tune you in to something that is wrong—it may become a problem when your interpretations are in overdrive. Furthermore, when you worry excessively, there is a negative filter operating on your thoughts which further intensifies and reinforces the worry.The bottom line is thoughts are powerful. When we experience a symptom such as pain, fatigue, or bloating, many people try to better understand and make sense of the experience, and depending on our thoughts, this may work for us or it may signal our thoughts are in overdrive. Additionally, constantly paying attention to bodily symptoms—and perhaps even creating symptoms, as you indicated—is a pattern worth changing. When we think the worst, this sends us down a dark path leading to debilitating anxiety. Furthermore, the way we think significantly affects the way we feel. So it makes sense that if we are thinking the worst about our health, we will feel bad. We are focusing on even the slightest discomfort or sensation and then feeling distressed over the worry around what it could mean. Clearly, you have realized that health-related anxiety or worry can become extremely uncomfortable.\n\nBy modifying the thoughts you have around bodily sensations, you can change your level of comfort. You will, in fact, be able to do just as you want—to be able to enjoy your life. Imagine how powerful a small shift in a thought can be. Instead of “This means I have a rare infection that will kill me,” try something else. Perhaps, “It is possible this is something that warrants medical attention, but it is also possible this will go away on its own.” You can learn how to modify your thoughts through psychotherapy. By seeking help for this, you can learn and practice skills to help you reduce hypervigilance and significantly reduce the tendency to immediately think the worst.\n\nHere are some other tips that are important to consider:\n\nBeware of conducting your own health-related research. Many individuals who experience illness anxiety find they spend a lot of time online researching suspected conditions or symptoms. I suspect you know this already, being a dental student, but sometimes reading about things that “could” happen serves as an unnecessary trigger for anxiety. Be mindful of the amount of time you spend conducting such research, as well as how you feel while reading information (especially compared to times when you are not reading about symptoms). I suspect such information may spike anxiety in you. If so, consider whether this is useful for you to do.\nConsider new ways of coping and reframing. You mentioned you gather that the people close to you are already getting annoyed by you regularly seeking reassurance. This is one mechanism you have developed as a pattern to manage anxiety. Another is to frequently make medical appointments for these symptoms, which is essentially doing the same thing. You want reassurance that everything is okay. Because neither of these practices is sustainable in the long run, you’ll have to learn additional coping and reframing skills so you can adequately assess when it may be appropriate to seek reassurance.\nImplement relaxation as a regular practice. What usually helps you reduce anxiety? Finding a healthy outlet for stress and anxiety can be a useful tool to have at your disposal, regardless of the stressors you face."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Overcome My Fear of Spiders?",
    "Question": "Okay, so I get that spiders play an important role in the ecosystem. I get that they keep mosquitoes under control. I know they don’t hunt people. I still have wicked nightmares about them covering my body in sticky silk and slowly draining the life out of me. I still want to burn my house down anytime I see one in my home. I still won’t go hiking or camping for fear of running into a web.\n\nI’ve definitely been bitten by spiders before. I am guessing most people have at one point or another. But I’ve never had an overly bad reaction to a bite, so I don’t know what it is about spiders that makes me react this way. I haven’t even seen the movie Arachnophobia (I’m told it wouldn’t help). Also, where I live, there is only one type of dangerous spider, and my chances of ever encountering it are next to zero.\n\nWhy, then, am I so afraid of spiders? Will I always be this way, or can arachnophobia be overcome? Are there therapies that help with this sort of fear specifically?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing and sharing so much about your fear. Just talking about the subject of a phobia can create a sense of anxiety, so I really appreciate your candor. As far as causes of arachnophobia, some research points to evolutionary explanations, meaning humans evolved to be afraid of spiders to avoid poisonous spider bites. Other research suggests social conditioning is the cause—if, as a child, you see people reacting with fear every time they see a spider, you may learn to be afraid of spiders too. Still other research suggests fear of spiders can be genetically inherited.\n\nThe good news is there is treatment that can help. Partnering with a therapist could give you the opportunity to uncover the root cause of your specific fear of spiders. Beyond possibly gaining an understanding of the origin of your phobia, you can also work on moving past it.The first step to getting treatment is finding the right therapist and treatment for you. Since there is something specific you want to work on—arachnophobia—it makes sense to start by looking for local therapists who have experience in treating this specific condition. Exposure therapies and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) are treatments commonly used to address phobias.\n\nAfter you identify a few therapists, call them and talk to them about what you are experiencing. Ask how they have been successful treating this issue in the past. Hopefully, these phone calls will give you a sense of which therapist and what approach you feel most drawn to. If you have it narrowed down to a couple of therapists, schedule consultations with both therapists to see which one seems like the best fit for you.\n\nI wish you success in finding the right therapist to help you tackle this. It sounds like this fear has created a lot of discomfort for you and even stopped you from doing some things you might otherwise enjoy—camping and hiking, for instance. You deserve a full, rich life free from this fear."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is Polyamory Right for Us If We Sometimes Experience Jealousy?",
    "Question": "One of my partners and I have been together for more than three years. About a year ago, we opened our relationship to a third person and ultimately both fell in love with her. We’ve been living together in a polyamorous triad for several months. You might consider us ethically nonmonogamous, in the sense there is open, honest, and constant communication among us about our intimate pursuits outside of the triad. Each of us has an equal say in shaping our dynamic. We all have veto power when it comes to introducing new partners, and we all practice safe sex both inside and outside the triad.\n\nAs with any relationship, though, it’s not all sizzle and fun. The everyday issues (division of labor, finances, etc.) you find in other relationships are issues for us too, though in some ways they’re actually easier to resolve given the extra set of hands and extra income. Other issues can be tougher to deal with, however. One of them is jealousy. While we all want to see our partners happy, we all deal with various levels of jealousy at times. I have read conflicting theories about this as it relates to “big” relationships like ours. On one side of the debate, people say jealousy is healthy so long as it is not accompanied by resentment. On the other side of the debate, people say you shouldn’t experience jealousy at all in a healthy relationship. So, which is it?\n\nI want to be clear that despite occasional jealousy issues, none of us has expressed unhappiness. We all say we’re more fulfilled (and not just sexually) now than we ever were in more traditional relationship structures. I don’t think any of us sees jealousy as something that will tear us apart. But I would like to hear from a therapist, ideally one who has experience working with nonmonogamous relationship structures, whether we’re looking at this the right way or whether perhaps we have work to do when it comes to understanding and processing our feelings of jealousy. Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "Oof! This topic is so important. You are certainly not alone in these value conflicts, as it seems you have already been made aware by outlining the “two sides” of the debate.\n\nI can appreciate that you are wanting a therapist to validate your perspective through clinical knowledge and experience. I also want to acknowledge that many therapists who are nonaffirming may inadvertently confirm your fears by pathologizing nonmonogamy or the experience of jealousy itself. Certainly, there are instances of jealousy as a warning sign in relationships, and there are partners who seek polyamory for the wrong reasons (or, rather, participate in unethical nonmonogamy and call it “poly”). But that’s not what you’re writing about here.\n\nI loved the way you defined “ethical nonmonogamy”—so much I’ll repeat those parameters here: (1) You and your partners engage in open, honest, and constant communication about your intimate pursuits outside of your triad; (2) each of you has an equal say in shaping your dynamic; (3) you all have veto power when it comes to introducing new partners; and (4) you all practice safe sex both inside and out of the triad.\n\nTo the extent there can be a “code of conduct” for nonmonogamous relationships, wouldn’t this be it? How many relationships, even monogamous partnerships, can truthfully report this same level of intentionality and authenticity? You’re all working hard on your relationship(s), and it shows in your writing.\n\nI want to expand on the divided perspectives from opposing sides of the debate you name, while acknowledging that sometimes these sorts of binaries perpetuate problems (that is, framing jealousy as a purely “good” or “bad” thing may be problematic on its own).\n\nRegarding jealousy, Shaun McGonigal of the Poly Skeptic blog astutely wrote in 2012, “Most resources I have seen seem to emphasize that the feeling is probably unwarranted; that what we fear is not happening and we need to stop being so suspicious. But when you share your lovers, the thing you feel jealous about is happening!” However, they report a rather damning prognosis for the presence of jealousy: “It is a sign of lack of trust, security, and can only act to drive people apart, rather than help in any way” (2012, paragraphs 11 and 13). I echo Labriola’s perspective on jealousy, and find fault with our tendency to diagnose jealousy as inherently damning. It doesn’t feel good, certainly. And it may indeed be rooted in ideology that conflicts with our “woke” values. However, I prefer to cast feelings in the roles of challenging teachers, holding compassion and curiosity about them rather than diagnosis and prescription. (What are they trying to teach you about yourself?) While you can place a code of conduct on your actions and systems of accountability, I think it is dangerous territory to place restrictions on emotions alone. You can’t police which emotions partners can and can’t have, and you can’t choose which emotions you will and won’t have. So, breathe a sigh of relief, collectively with your partners, and alleviate yourselves of that burden as soon as possible.As a therapist working with any person who is trying to “do the right thing,” I see that some are hard on themselves not just for what they do, but for what they think. This can create a snowball effect that looks like: “Oh no, I have this thing (the feeling)”; “oh no, there’s something wrong (anxiety about the original feeling)”; “oh no, I shouldn’t have this (prescription of the feeling as bad).” This chain of command can exacerbate the original feeling when we have shame about it. It seems that some in the poly community may be inadvertently shaming folks for their jealousy in a manner that could be silencing, even if unintentionally.\n\nYou intuit that your partners don’t see the jealousy as something that will tear you apart. I think that’s important. Perhaps listen to what the jealousy is telling you—something about yourself rather than the relationship structure, perhaps?\n\nIf the jealousy illuminates an unsustainable relationship structure, figure out how to communicate about that. Labriola’s workbook may be a good resource for you, or you and your partners could seek out an affirming therapist who is competent and open to navigating complex and nontraditional relationship structures.\n\nSo often, jealousy illuminates our greatest fears and doubts. Sometimes it will point you in the direction of “something needs to change between us,” but other times you may just need to develop stronger coping skills for standing strong in the face of fears. Indeed, any partnership is a leap of faith and a conscious decision to trust another person.\n\nThere isn’t a one-size-fits-all or “right” way to love, but jealousy tends to surface in most relationship structures at one time or another (again, how many monogamous couples struggle with jealousy?). Please also consider the newness of your newest partner—often, jealousy is strongest in the first year or two of a partnership as there has not yet been enough time for structures to stabilize and reliability to be demonstrated over time. Please be gentle and patient with yourselves."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Get Noticed at Work If My Supervisor Takes All the Credit?",
    "Question": "I work in an office where there are multiple layers of management, making it hard for the people at the bottom (like me) to get noticed by the people at the top. We are encouraged to bring our ideas forward, but to do so within the “chain of command”—meaning my ideas go to my direct supervisor, who in turn is supposed to present those ideas to top executives. The problem is my ideas are often not shared with those at the top, making it hard for me to get noticed by the people who ultimately control my future at this company. Worse yet, in some cases my supervisor is actually taking credit for my ideas. I know this because I have seen memos circulated where my supervisor is being credited and appreciated for things I personally did. This infuriates me!\n\nI know you will probably recommend that I meet with my supervisor about this, but since this person evaluates me and controls my raises, I feel like there is strong potential for negative repercussions. If I go straight to top management, then I am not honoring the chain of command as instructed. And we all know human resources (HR) is there not to look out for employees but rather to protect the company from liability, so I don’t think that’s a viable solution, either.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. I love my job, but it’s very discouraging and upsetting when the work I do is not recognized as mine. It’s hard to feel valued. Do you have any ideas as to how I can get noticed and properly credited for the things I contribute at work? Thank you for your time.",
    "TherapistReply": "What a frustrating situation! It sounds like you feel stuck between wanting the recognition you deserve and fearing the repercussions of trying to achieve it. That feels like a no-win situation, and I imagine you are feeling pretty powerless. This also feels like a clash between what is “right” and what is pragmatic. It isn’t okay for someone to claim credit for your work. It is also true that some people (and organizations) do not operate with a shared sense of ethical obligation. You have every right to self-advocate. You also have the right not to if that is what will ultimately serve you the best.\n\nYou are wise to recognize that the person who is in charge of your evaluations and promotions is a risky person to air your grievance with. Unfortunately, your supervisor is also the person whose behaviors you’d like to change—and that will not happen without your concerns being brought to light.\n\nAre there others in the company who have this experience? There can be strength in numbers if enough of you share this concern. If you have colleagues who have experienced this, they may have recommendations about what can and cannot work in your particular office environment. Where might you find sources of support within your organization? Also, is this dynamic part of the corporate culture (did your supervisor experience the same thing as part of “paying dues”), or is it specific to this supervisor? Your most effective strategy will depend in large part on the answers to some of these questions.\n\nI do want to challenge your assumption that human resources (HR) cannot be a resource for you. Supporting employees might be seen as a good way to support the company. HR wants to protect the company from liability, and part of that is making sure employees feel they are being treated fairly (and thus are less likely to put forward claims of mistreatment). I know some agencies offer mediated conversations between supervisor and supervisee that are attended by an HR representative. It might be worth checking in about what resources are in place and how they are accessed.I am sure you’ve run through various scenarios in your mind. Is your supervisor aware of their actions and the impact they have on you? If this were brought to awareness, would you be met with defensiveness or openness? If you were to raise concerns, would your situation improve or would you risk things getting worse? Might you even risk losing your job?\n\nWithout knowing your specific work culture, how feedback is handled within the organization, and how employees are evaluated, it is impossible to give you specific suggestions. The question I do have for you is where you stand on the balance of loving your job and being discouraged and resentful about not being recognized for the work you do. At what point will the frustration become big enough to stop you from loving your job?\n\nWe are more likely to take risks when the potential negative outcomes feel manageable. What are you willing to risk in order to potentially make your situation feel better?\n\nOne final thought: When we find ourselves in circumstances that are unacceptable to us, we ultimately have two choices—change our circumstances or change how we feel about them. In other words, you can take action (finding a new job, bringing your concerns into the open) or you can find acceptance with the status quo. Only you know which path will best serve you."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Dad Was Sexually Abused as a Child. Should I Talk to Him About It?",
    "Question": "My mom and dad divorced when I was 14. I’m in my forties now. Neither of my parents is in the best of health, and I don’t know how much time left I have with them. They don’t talk to each other. I’m on good terms with both of them, though closer to my dad.\n\nI was visiting my mom a couple of years ago when she told me a bombshell of a family secret: my dad had been sexually abused by a pastor as a child. This went on for years, apparently. It seems my mom is the only person in our family he has told about this—assuming she is to be believed. I add this qualifier because she has a history of creating drama. I have not known her to outright lie, however.\n\nI am inclined to believe her, as I know my dad was raised in a devout, church-going family and he has never been one to be very open with his feelings, emotions, or past experiences. If he was indeed abused as a child, I think it’s likely he’d hide it from his children, out of what I would imagine is a deep sense of shame.\n\nIt’s my empathy and compassion for that shame that has kept me from saying anything to him these past couple of years. One the one hand, I really want him to be able to talk about his past with me. Part of me thinks that by talking about it, he might be able to make peace with it (assuming he hasn’t already) and perhaps have fewer regrets as the end of his life approaches. On the other hand, I don’t want to push him into talking about something he doesn’t feel comfortable talking about. The one thing I am sure of is that he’ll take this to his grave if I don’t bring it up. If I do bring it up, I would not be surprised if he denied it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I try to get him to talk to me about this?",
    "TherapistReply": "What a fascinating question—and touching, since your empathy for your father is so obvious. I’m moved by how you want to help him find peace with what sounds like a pretty awful betrayal and abuse of trust. As the film Spotlight illustrated, it’s terribly painful when “God’s ambassadors” are the ones perpetuating such psychological and/or physical injury, which can leave scars for a lifetime.\n\nI suppose my main question is: whose peace are you actually seeking? It sounds as if you are nagged by the question or impulse to help him. My question is, and I mean this in a deep sense: how come? This is not to sound skeptical; I just find it’s helpful to understand one’s own impulse to help. There are times when, in my own experience, the relief cuts two ways—one for the other person and two for ourselves, since we are troubled by such a disturbing disclosure.\n\nWanting to help our parents as they grow older is one way many of us want to “give back” for what we are just now beginning to appreciate. It sounds as though you have an intuitive sense of how this might be bothering your father. I also wonder if your mother told you because she either was tired of carrying such a secret herself all these years or was hoping you might find a way to approach him. Did she say this to you in confidence, or is she okay with you bringing it to him?\n\nIt’s impossible for me (and you, it sounds like) to know how your father has or hasn’t made peace with this. I have learned not to underestimate the ability of the human mind to compartmentalize. We have to, in order to adapt and move forward. Where adaptation becomes repression or dissociation can be ambiguous, since every person, every relationship, and every situation is different.\n\nI would still advise you to pause a moment to gently reflect on your motives and feelings. What are you hoping might come of an honest conversation with your dad? If he has never really dealt with it, it’s unlikely one conversation will clear it up. It might—or it might stir up all kinds of complex feelings around what happened. He may feel anger at the perpetrator and those who failed to protect him as a boy. It’s also possible he doesn’t know how he feels, or harbors deeper feelings that may arise in a conversation and take time to process (which doesn’t mean “don’t do it,” just that he might say no before he says yes, or say no and want to reflect on it himself).\n\nHe may also have feelings about your mother disclosing this to you. Again, I don’t know anyone involved or the dynamics of the family, but sometimes there is an unspoken need among family members for a secret to come out in the open, and sometimes there is conflict around it. He may chuckle and say, “Oh, your mom …” or he may become angry about having his secret spilled.Is it possible your mother wants your dad to discuss it while he is reluctant or outright disinterested? Are you then concerned about your mother’s distress? Is your mother enlisting you as a kind of stand-in for her own pursuit? The “drama” you allude to regarding your mom might be a way for her to attract attention while avoiding her own feelings or vulnerability.\n\nIf any of this is true, keep in mind the risk of wading into a longstanding struggle; sometimes adult children are the “power brokers” or go-betweens in such situations. This has its benefits and risks, naturally. I recommend considering the downside of stepping in, along with the potential benefits. It’s also true any decision you make will have potential ups and downs, and there is often no easy choice. I sense you care deeply about both of your folks—and at the end of the day, provided you move with empathy for all involved (as best you can), this is what matters most.\n\nShould you decide you’d like to try discussing this with him, I would broach the topic gently and see if he wants to discuss it before specifics are introduced. You can come from a place of your own concern, even curiosity, about his experience, and ask if talking would help him—rather than coming at him with a pre-decided or firm intent to help (which can be received as critical, if a person hasn’t asked for it).\n\nI often encourage people to ask, “How can I help?” before deciding for the other person what’s needed or how it ought to play out. (Not that you’re doing this.) I often ask people in therapy (or even loved ones) if they want suggestions before offering my own advice. It surprises me how, so much of the time, people just want to be heard, validated, understood … so they don’t feel so alone in their struggle.\n\nOf course, you may hit a wall with him. He may resist and then come around, or he might surprise you by being open right at the start.\n\nIf you decide to broach the topic, the key is to be honest with him about your love and concern for him. It’s a bit of a tightrope, wanting to be transparently honest without falling into “you need to do this, dad” when the motivation may be your own anxiety. One thing to consider is whether some of the shame and darkness you imagine he’s feeling is, possibly, what you are feeling. It’s painful and difficult to think of a person you love being harmed in such a way.\n\nIn short, the “lead” as they say in journalism is your love and concern for him, your empathy, in compassionately considering him and his (conscious or unconscious) struggle, and your wanting to lighten the load. One of the most loving things you can do is to ask if or how you can help with all this—if you decide to talk to him. (If this is a real hot button between your folks, it’s also okay to recuse yourself.) Let him decide whether he wants to open this door wider or at all, or would rather leave sleeping traumas be.\n\nI hope, whatever happens, he will be proud of a son who cares enough about his dad to take a risk.\n\nFinally, please know there is no “perfect decision” in such cases. Often, in the messiness and muddle of human affairs, we simply do the best we can. Sounds to me like you’re a good son trying to do just that."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! How Do I Deal with All This Resentment?",
    "Question": "I am having trouble living with the constant resentment I feel toward other parents, friends, even my husband.\n\nI have three children, two who play competitive sports. Our community is small, so everyone knows everyone. Lately, all I am hearing about and seeing on social media is updates about what amazing athletes other people’s children are and how they are going to nationals, etc. My child was not on the team this year because she is one year older. Her sports season was amazing; however, it ended with a totally unfair and biased decision made against her team, stripping them of the medal they deserved. My friend’s child’s team got to nationals on a little piece of luck that went their way, not talent.\n\nI know this makes me sound bitter and maybe I am. I just can’t deal with the constant bragging about it when I am sitting here with one kid who is going nowhere in life, and the other two who are constantly getting tough breaks, much like myself. This is just one example.\n\nI am also so resentful of women who get to stay at home and be around for their kids. I am resentful of my husband for not being able to support us without my income, forcing me into jobs I despise. I am boiling over with this. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "TherapistReply": "I think it is great you’ve reached out for help with your resentment concerns. You’ve already seen for yourself the most fundamental aspects about resentment: (1) Resentful thoughts are powerful, and (2) harboring resentment, over time, becomes toxic. For you, the resentment has creeped into many aspects of your daily life and relationships. It has made you feel negative emotions and reinforced negative thoughts. It has become highly uncomfortable and seeped into how you feel generally. Most importantly, you are noticing you’ve hit the “boiling” point—you know it is time to change things, and you’re wanting to do something to make a change.\n\nTo effectively deal with resentment, you’ll need to both identify what is triggering the resentment and be honest with yourself about how you are dealing with the resentment. When do you notice resentment? Using the example of your child’s sports team, does resentment seep in the moment you see that photo of another player proudly shared on social media, accompanied by a massive amount of “likes” and congratulatory comments, juxtaposed with few congratulatory messages or even acknowledgements for your child on your social media feed? What thoughts does that trigger in you? Perhaps this provides more evidence that confirms what you already believe—that you have gotten a raw deal but others seem to get a lucky break? Do you extrapolate from the specific (e.g., this photo) to the general (e.g., “Once again, nothing is ever fair for me” or “How disgusting that they always need to brag”)?\n\nSimilarly, ask yourself what you do about this resentment typically. Do you withdraw from others (perhaps anyone you know who is associated with this team)? Do you engage in talking negatively about these people to others? Do you hold it all in and stew internally?\n\nNext, go through the same questions about feeling resentful and explore how the questions relate to your marriage, your or your children’s successes and failures, jobs you “despise,” etc. How does resentment manifest?\n\nNow that you have a better handle on how resentment is affecting you, the next thing you’ll need to figure out is what you can do about it. Taking action will take both effort and energy. That said, think of all the energy going toward feeling resentful. Ask yourself if is this how you want to spend your energy. It is up to you to consciously make that decision. This is something you have control over. One potentially helpful approach is to explore and work through these issues with a therapist.While in therapy or on your own, something I would strongly recommend for overcoming resentment is to change some of your thoughts. You’ll need to take an honest look at the thoughts you have and consider the effect of these thoughts on how you feel. Generally speaking, our thoughts shape how we feel. Reframing the negative thoughts into something more constructive will be key. For example, if an event happens that makes you feel disappointed or resentful, you might say to yourself, “While that didn’t go my way this time, perhaps next time it can.” A small shift in thinking opens the possibility of a positive outcome. On the other hand, assuming there will be another unfair outcome taints how you view the situation. You’re essentially searching for confirmatory evidence to support this (irrational) belief.\n\nAnother practice I strongly recommend is focusing on gratitude. Despite how you feel about your circumstances, surely there are things you can identify to feel grateful for. For example, it sounds like your daughter is a talented athlete in her own right. How much do you appreciate the opportunity to watch her play, succeed, and enjoy herself while doing something that brings her joy? Does it bring you joy?\n\nI’ll leave you with this advice: Be the change you want to see happen in your life. If you want to be less resentful, make a conscious effort to be more something else (e.g., grateful). Be an active participant in how you view your life rather than the voice that provides the negative commentary. When we consistently think life isn’t fair, we are setting ourselves (specifically our emotional health) up for failure. What is missing from these thoughts is YOU. Taking control of how YOU respond may change how you feel."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Don’t Know How to Say No to My Adult Children",
    "Question": "First, let me say I don’t think I’m a great parent, but I do try to be one. I know the way I parent is different than how a lot of people are with their kids. I just don’t know if that’s good or bad.\n\nMy kids are grown up. My son is 24 and lives with his girlfriend in an apartment a few miles away. My daughter is 25, lives halfway across the country, and recently graduated from college with a degree in anthropology. Neither is employed. I am retired and financially comfortable, so I am able to help them. And by help, I mean fully support them.\n\nI know a lot of parents would cut the cord completely and let their kids fend for themselves. I just don’t feel good about that. My kids had a rough childhood with their dad, who was an alcoholic (he killed himself in 2006). He was really hard on them. They didn’t deserve that.\n\nWhen my kids ask for money or other assistance, I can’t bring myself to say no. They heard “no” too much as kids. On the flip side, I acknowledge this might mean they are becoming dependent on me. My friend tells me they are taking advantage of me and are less motivated to find work because I help them. She’s probably right, but I still can’t bring myself to say no to them. I love them very much, and I am able to help them, so what’s the harm?\n\nI guess I am asking whether you think I’m wrong.

Your kids may not have had the childhood you would have chosen for them, but that does not mean you owe them more because of it. No parent is ever able to meet all of their children’s needs—we do the best we can given our circumstances and abilities. I imagine you did the best you could with what you had available. For the record, hearing “no” as a child can sometimes be the best thing for us.\n\nOften, when I work with new parents, I ask them what they want most for their kids. Almost every time, they answer, “I just want my kids to be happy.” I subsequently disappoint them when I suggest happiness is not the primary goal of parenting. Equipping our children to cope with the world, to manage their lives, and to develop resiliency are better goals. It is less outcome focused and more skills focused, and helps our children develop the tools they need to be able to experience happiness—competence, purpose, and confidence they can weather any storm. That means letting them struggle while being a soft place for them to land when they fall.This does not mean you should yank your support in order to force your children to be resilient. It doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. You may want to decide for yourself what you are willing to offer, and then have conversations with each of them as to what form that support might take. You might set a timeline and a budget that works for you—enough to help them until they get established, but not so much they can abdicate responsibility for their own lives. I’ve seen parents who decided they were willing to pay for car insurance, or half the rent, or a set amount each month. If you ask your kids what form of support would be most helpful, you can engage with them as the adults they are becoming while holding to limits that feel reasonable to you.\n\nYou may also want to talk with a therapist about any lingering feelings of guilt. There may be some emotional healing you and your kids need, but financial support has never been an adequate substitute for emotional support. It can even create barriers when the relationship becomes one of obligation and entitlement.\n\nBy setting a limit with your children, you would be letting them know you want to support and help them while also communicating you have confidence in their abilities to create their own lives."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! How Do I Tell My Partner I Have an STD?",
    "Question": "I’m pretty sure I met the love of my life three weeks ago. I’m falling for him fast. He’s kind, compassionate, generous, funny, and maybe best of all, great with my kids. I’m 37, and I honestly didn’t think I would ever meet someone who made me this happy!\n\nHere is my problem: I have resisted having sex with him in part because I am not sure how to tell him about the fact I have a sexually transmitted disease. Although I don’t feel comfortable specifying here which STD it is exactly, I will say it is not life-threatening. It can be life-altering, however, and does have some long-term risks associated with it (namely, a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer). If we are sexually active for a period of time, it’s fairly likely he’ll get it eventually, even if we always use protection.\n\nFor our relationship to have a chance, I know I have to tell him. I just don’t know how. I am so afraid he won’t want to have anything to do with me anymore. If I lost him over this, I would be heartbroken. I don’t know if I can deal with that.\n\nSo I’m not sure what to do. I am actually contemplating telling him I want to wait a while (maybe months) before we take the next step, which would give me more time to (1) make sure our relationship has a longer-term future and (2) formulate a plan. I also feel like the longer we’re together and the more he has invested, the less likely he might be to walk away when I tell him. How awful of a human being am I?",
    "TherapistReply": "You’re not an awful human being. We all bring the totality of our past experiences with us into new relationships—emotional scars from childhood or previous relationships, messy financial situations, and yes, in some cases even STDs. Regardless of what the challenge is, you have a right to wait until you feel ready to share it; you also have the responsibility of sharing it before your partner is likely to be harmed or personally affected. You’ve indicated you don’t plan to have sex with him until disclosing your STD, so you aren’t placing him at physical risk.\n\nYou may be right; he might very well be less likely to walk away if he has become invested in the relationship. Because you immediately raised the question of “how awful a human being” you are after positing this idea, it leads me to believe you feel guilty about this. As with many aspects of relationships, it’s not quite so simple. It sounds like having this STD is embarrassing and maybe even painful for you. Does it seem like a reasonable expectation for you to share the parts of yourself that you have a difficult time accepting within the first few weeks of meeting someone? Does it seem more reasonable to get to know and trust a person before sharing such private details of your life?You also say you would be “heartbroken if you lost him over this.” That’s the flip side of waiting for a shared investment to develop—the longer you wait, the greater the loss will be if he decides he doesn’t want to take the risk of contracting the STD. It might also be possible that if he feels like you waited too long, he could feel a sense of distrust because you kept something from him. He may feel your decision to wait until he was more invested was manipulative and unfair.\n\nThere’s a lot to balance here. I imagine it can feel lonely and overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to. You might benefit from partnering with a therapist to try to come up with a course of action that feels right for you. Therapy might also help you to come to terms with some of the seemingly unresolved feelings you have about having an STD."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Hate My Parents—and I Hate Myself Because of It",
    "Question": "I’ll just say it: I hate my parents with every fiber of my being. I’m pretty sure they hate me, too. My dad beat me almost every day when I was little, and never had anything nice to say when I was growing up. He was always on drugs, burned me with his cigarettes, told me I was garbage. Which is exactly what I felt like. My mom stood by and let it happen. He hit her too. I watched it happen. She took it out on me. She wouldn’t even let me eat some nights. I wish I had reported them, but I never did. I was too afraid of what would happen to me.\n\nI am 27 now, and until last week I had not talked to either of my parents in years. Then, out of the blue, my mom calls me. I hung up right away. She’s called me twice since, leaving messages saying she hopes I’m happy. She said she thinks I should forgive them and doesn’t understand why I won’t talk to her. I’m like, “Really?”\n\nI don’t know why she’s suddenly interested in my life, but I don’t care. I’m not one of those people who thinks just because you accidentally got pregnant and had a kid, your kid owes you something. I had terrible parents. I had the worst childhood you can imagine. I don’t want to be my parents’ son anymore. I don’t want anything to do with them. I don’t see that ever changing, either.\n\nI know hate is an ugly word. Article after article says it’s “unhealthy” to hate and that it’s “healthy” to forgive. But I hate my parents. I can’t forgive them. And what’s worse is I hate that I hate my parents, which makes me hate myself. I don’t know what to do with that except what I’ve always done: nothing.",
    "TherapistReply": "I’m sorry to hear about what sounds like an awful childhood. In some ways, the blaming and emotional abuse you experienced may be even more impactful than the physical abuse; scars that remain invisible often take the longest to acknowledge and heal.\n\nYou mention reading about how it’s “healthy” forgive one’s parents, let go of the past, etc. Whenever I’ve talked with people about some of their overwhelmingly toxic parents (yours appear to fit in that category, I’m afraid), I’ve had cause to doubt this maxim profoundly. In some cases, we may be unable to forgive until there has been some parental or caregiver recognition of the abuse and suffering inflicted upon us. Furthermore, an ongoing lack of recognition of abuse or neglect indicates the toxicity persists. Setting a boundary, as you have, is reasonable and may in fact be the safest way forward.\n\nWhatever your mother’s reasons for wanting to connect with you, she cannot reasonably expect to set the terms of any relationship with you. The terms are yours to define, and she needs to respect them, even if it means no contact.\n\nEmotional experience is subtle and complex. It’s possible—through therapy and other avenues— to simultaneously heal wounds of the past and set boundaries with toxic others. It is vital to acknowledge your emotional authenticity and experience, however painful or awkward. Otherwise, your psychological agency is in danger of becoming fractured, dissociated, or radically undermined.\n\nThis brings to mind a person I worked with many years ago whose mother actively intervened (starting in elementary school) to ruin her son’s friendships with others because she felt no one was “good” or “pure” enough. The way she “protected” him was to gossip behind his back to teachers and his friends’ parents about what a untrustworthy and generally nasty kid he was, going so far as to whisper in the ear of the local pastor to keep an eye on her “wayward” son. This awful behavior had the desired effect: the friends he wanted were told by their parents to stay away from him, and he grew up with insecurity issues that led to drug addiction.\n\nWhen he grew older and entered therapy, the son fiercely resented his mother’s behavior (while struggling with guilt over “hating” her) and refused to comply with her demands that he write and call her regularly. He came to recognize her chief aim was to isolate him—a classic abuse technique—so he might become a surrogate “friend” and stop trying to have his own life. Her alcohol-addicted husband worked long hours, and when home he remained locked in his den watching television, sipping booze. Unable to address her husband, she directed her rage at her son and essentially held him hostage with her manipulations and subterfuge.\n\nA couple of years ago, I had the good fortune of studying with a longtime psychoanalyst and mentor. I asked about forgiveness of one’s parents as a “must.” You see, I had inadvertently caused some controversy in one of my doctoral seminars after reading an article by a psychoanalyst who felt that forgiving one’s parents was a sign of maturity; I disagreed, as I felt there could be no global rule about forgiveness as it pertains to one’s parents, and clashed with my fellow students and instructors.\n\nMy mentor waved off this “doctrine” in no uncertain terms. “Why do you have to forgive your parents?” he wondered aloud. “I’ve never been a fan of that idea. Especially if they were horrible to their kids. Am I going to tell a woman who experienced incest with her dad, with a mom who denied such things ever happened, ‘get over it’ or ‘move on’? Of course not. And anyway, do we really want requirements of the people we help? What do we do if they can’t or won’t forgive? Refuse to see them? Give them moral instruction? That’s repeating the very abuse they’re trying so hard to escape.”\n\nAll of this is a way of saying this: Do what feels safe and right to you. Keep your boundary. The fact you took the time to write means there’s some part of you that treasures your own preservation and well-being; trust your instincts! Also, the fact you have set a boundary and had such a human, understandable, and honest reaction to your mother’s recent contact tells me you’re probably the healthiest person in your family. The healthiest person is often the first to seek therapy, as it turns out.Speaking of which, I would encourage you to seek a counselor, preferably one who can address the psychodynamics of such pernicious abuse. The damage can be very subtle. I discovered over time that the kind of harsh and unspeakably cruel treatment you received may impact a person in a way that can be hard to assess without empathic observation and support.\n\nYou might say the vulnerable part of us, which we have to hide or “put away” in an abusive context, inevitably emerges as we try to fulfill our hopes and goals for an authentic life, especially in regard to relationships with others (sexual/romantic, friendships, even educationally or professionally). Sustaining hope means remaining vulnerable. Some people end up sabotaging their own hopes, or withdrawing from life, due to the savagery of past suffering. Finding a competent healer might be the most loving thing you could do for yourself.\n\nHating your parents is one thing. Hating yourself for hating them is quite another. You clearly don’t deserve that burden. A competent therapist can help you recognize and have compassion for the forces at work in your self-directed misgivings.\n\nOne final note: Are there are any other family members you can talk to who “get” your experience and can validate it? A cousin, aunt or uncle, even close family friend? The son I spoke of earlier had an aunt who was far more balanced than his own mother, and he and his aunt developed a fairly close rapport. The aunt validated his experience as real, which was an important aspect of his coming to terms with his experience and moving forward.\n\nI hope this has been helpful. I further hope you are able to find the peace so unfairly denied to you by your parents."

    "QuestionTitle": "Therapy Isn’t Helping. Is My Therapist Stringing Me Along?",
    "Question": "I am hoping you can give me an honest answer here. I have been seeing a therapist for nearly three years now and I just don’t feel like it’s working for me. I don’t feel any different than when I started. In some ways, I feel even worse, because I am discouraged about therapy not helping. It makes me wonder what is wrong with me that I can’t get better. I have read that it is highly unusual for someone to be in therapy as long as I have.\n\nI guess I should provide some background about my “issues.” As a kid, I was molested for years by an uncle, saw my parents die, and was bullied incessantly. I have been told I have major depression and have tried about half a dozen kinds of medication, none of which have made a shred of difference. I have self-esteem problems. I can’t seem to hold down a job. I haven’t been in a relationship for five years; women won’t even look at me, and I don’t blame them. I hate my life and I have no friends. Yes, I have considered suicide. No, I am not currently suicidal. I know that distinction is important to people who do what you do.\n\nBecause therapy isn’t helping me and hasn’t helped in all the time I’ve been in it, I want to stop. I feel like I am throwing away money. I feel un-helpable. I must be one of the few cases out there for whom there is no relief, whose problems are just too many and too major. I might be a lost cause. But I do not want to be a fool. My therapist has encouraged me to continue with therapy and to not give up hope. She says she has seen signs of progress but cannot seem to articulate them in a way that allows me to see them too. Maybe that is my failing, but I am starting to feel like maybe I’m just a paycheck for her. I don’t think she is necessarily a bad therapist. She is a nice person and she tries. She seems to truly care. I just think she isn’t helping me, I think she knows she’s not helping me, and I no longer really think anyone can.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is she just stringing me along? Are there other people like me who don’t seem to get any better, and if so, what do you recommend in those cases? Please answer these questions. Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "What a great question regarding a terribly painful situation. I’m glad to hear from you about this, while so sorry to hear about all you have endured. Let me first give you my impressions in a way that “cuts to the chase,” then flesh things out a bit.\n\nFirst, it is not unusual for it to take a while to find the right medication or combination of medications. (For instance, some people respond better to an older generation of medications, while others respond to SSRIs.) Have you tried more than one psychiatrist? I would encourage you to keep trying, discouraging as it has been. I have worked with a few people in therapy who were as discouraged as you, but managed to find an effective medication plan that helped them enormously.\n\nYou have been through hell and back. The fact you are still standing says something about your resilience. You have suffered enough trauma for several lifetimes, so it’s understandable you would feel this way. Your life experience has, I sadly observe, given you no tangible reason to hold onto hope. It does not mean there is none to be found, however; in fact, your letter indicates you are searching for it, itself is a glimmer of something positive.\n\nAs to your therapy question: Any therapist worth their salt would welcome any and all the feedback you have put forth here. My impression is it is time to have a blunt and honest conversation with your therapist regarding your feelings; if you’re still dissatisfied afterward, it may well be time to seek out someone new.\n\nI would guess you had no source of true comfort after seeing your parents die. How unspeakably sad! I can hardly imagine a more hellish experience, in that the people you may have relied on most for comfort are the ones you lost. This, in addition to the other psychological injuries you experienced, leads to my amazement at your resilience. My great hope is you find, sooner rather than later, the kind of therapeutic “holding” and healing you deserve.\n\nIn the meantime, you seem to know intuitively you’re not getting what you need. I would be curious to know what keeps you in therapy with your current therapist. Have you tried telling her directly what you say in your letter? If not, why not? Is it possible she has helped as much as she can and now it’s time for a new approach? It is not uncommon, after all, to seek a second opinion medically; I believe this applies to psychotherapy also.\n\nSometimes people in therapy are afraid that, because they are not the “authority,” they do not have the last word on their own experience. You sound almost convinced it’s time to move on or ask directly that your therapist change her approach; I encourage you to follow your intuition. Whether or not it’s worth one last conversation with your therapist is obviously your call. Such a conversation could prove healing or just add fuel to frustration. If you feel you would benefit somehow from clearing the air, it’s worth a try. If, however, you feel it’s a foregone conclusion, you might want to move on.\n\nIs it possible you doubt your own perceptions (not unusual with depression) in that she sees progress while you don’t, leading you to wonder if she is “right”? If the latter is true, she needs to find a way to convey her observations in a way that is meaningful to you. If your therapist insists you “hang in there” for no reason that feels solid, that’s simply not good enough; the direct experience of the person in therapy is, in my view, always front and center in therapeutic inquiry and exploration.\n\nI don’t expect the people I work with in therapy to understand everything that flows from my lips. I have to learn a person’s language—and, to paraphrase Carl Jung, each of us speaks differently. I cannot insist on calling anything “progress” if the person in therapy feels or perceives otherwise. In the absence of mutual resonance regarding progress and therapeutic aims, the person in therapy feels dangerously alone.\n\nGiven your dwindling (or absent) faith in the process, it makes sense you are feeling alone in this relationship. It almost seems this alone-ness may even echo or parallel earlier suffering with the traumatic isolation and self-doubt you describe. I can’t shake the feeling you sense painful distance or discrepancy between you and your therapist, that she is missing something essential. I am not blaming her—nor you, for that matter. Do you somehow feel pressured to “live up to” her seeing progress? Are you concerned that if she feels disappointed or anxious about “progress,” it could be a bad sign?Therapists seek a tricky balance between instilling hope and validating a person’s pain—mostly because, in so many cases, the latter has never been permitted or acknowledged by caregivers. Strangely, the more a pain is accepted as valid in the context of a person’s experience—with a safe other who can stay with you during and through that pain—the more healing the process becomes. It’s when we begin to fear that emotional pain is “too much” for us or the other, or that it’s a sign of weakness on our part—that we need to “get over it already,” etc.—that it lingers like an unwelcome guest.\n\nI believe people are entitled to all of their feelings, including and especially about therapy, because no one knows your experience better than you. I can’t imagine anything more important in your therapy than what you have bravely expressed in your letter. I am grateful you are not suicidal, but it sounds bad enough that an adjustment needs to happen, either within the current therapy or with someone new. (If thoughts of hurting yourself do resurface, please call 911 go to your nearest emergency room immediately.)\n\nYou sound very certain your therapist “knows she’s not helping me,” though I would urge you to not jump to the conclusion that no one can. The latter can be a hallmark or emotional symptom of depression—the sense one is cosmically alone in the universe, unable to connect with anyone. This feeling is, sadly, more common than many people realize. But this feeling is not objective “truth.” Your situation is not hopeless, and the fact you wrote your letter suggests you may leave room for hope, too. It is vital your therapist help you believe this more expansively.\n\nWhen it comes to feedback, vital in any therapy, I try my best to listen nondefensively to where a person is or is not happy with me or how things are going with the two of us. My aim is to do no harm and be as helpful as possible. I do not assume I am always on the right track, or that no feedback means everything is fine and dandy.\n\nThere needs to be, more often than not, some mutually understood “map” of where we are going, and why—in your case, that would plainly include relief from traumatic anguish. The work can be difficult, even painful, at times, but for the sake of a treatment plan (ethically required), the “plan” needs to be something the person in therapy understands, endorses, and trusts as desirable.\n\nOnce a person begins to feel overly “protective” of the therapist’s feelings, which the therapist might tacitly encourage, the process is in danger of shutting down or becoming overly burdensome to the person, adding to their trauma and emotional isolation. Maybe the person has never had a chance to be fully honest with another, which can feel scary or even risky. The very act of sharing this disappointment can be healing, which is why I do my best to encourage it.\n\nI would be curious to know if you are getting help with managing painful or traumatic emotions or emotional states between sessions. Do you need concrete help dealing with feelings of despair or low self-worth? There are cognitive behavioral approaches, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness, and other techniques to help with such moments.\n\nPlease do not give up. I wish you the best of luck in your pursuit of much-deserved relief."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! How Do I Get My Husband to Court Me Again?",
    "Question": "I have been married to my husband for 12 years and I love him with all my heart. I would never dream of leaving him, so I want to get that out of the way right off the bat. But there is no question the spark in our marriage has faded over the years, and it leaves me wanting in some ways.\n\nWhen we first got together, things were pretty hot and heavy. After we got married, and especially after we had kids, things cooled off considerably. I recognize that this pattern is probably typical. We still treat each other like best friends and do sometimes have sex (great sex, by the way), but the courting has stopped. That’s why I’m writing. I miss being courted. I am sure we both take it for granted that we are a couple and I’m sure day-to-day life saps opportunities for romance, but I miss the feeling of being wanted, the thrill of the chase, the sense that being together is not a given but rather a choice.\n\nI have mentioned a couple of times that I miss date nights, flowers, simple gestures, things like that, and while it’s usually met with a hug, a smile, and an “Aw, I love you, babe,” it hasn’t resulted in any meaningful attempts on his part to court me again. I feel like he’s not taking me very seriously. And I suppose I wonder just how serious I am, since I am very happily married even though I feel like things could be even better.\n\nSo I’m not sure what to do, basically. Should I just be happy that I am happy? Do I need to take initiative by courting him? Am I being stupid or selfish for wanting to be courted? Is courting even something I should expect at this stage of marriage?",
    "TherapistReply": "No, you are absolutely not being stupid or selfish! It’s totally normal to miss the romance, passion, and excitement that typically exist in the early days of a relationship. It is also totally normal for it to have faded. Relationships, like most things, evolve and change over time. After 12 years of marriage and children, there are probably some aspects of your relationship that have deepened and grown—perhaps a sense of trust, commitment, and security.\n\nWhile acknowledging the positive changes in the marriage might offer valuable perspective, it certainly doesn’t mean you aren’t entitled to miss the thrill of being wanted and pursued. So the question becomes what can you do to try to get some of that fire back? You asked if you should take some initiative by courting him; I think that might be a great place to start. Show him what you want by giving it to him, in whatever way he is most likely to recognize its value and embrace it. Perhaps he will be excited by the spark to the marriage and follow suit.You say you have mentioned a couple of times that you miss date nights, flowers, and simple gestures. This makes me wonder if you have mentioned this in passing … a couple of times. If this is the case, it seems quite possible your husband doesn’t have a real sense of how much this means to you. He might better understand how important this is to you if you sit down and have a full conversation about this, as opposed to a passing comment here and there.\n\nIf neither of the aforementioned approaches produces the change you are seeking, you might want to partner with a couples therapist. It might seem excessive to consider seeking therapy when you describe yourself as happy and loving your husband with all your heart. However, you also describe yourself as wanting. Couples therapy can be valuable during times when a marriage is in pretty good shape but there is a little hiccup or identifiable room for growth. At this stage, given the relatively happy state of your marriage, couples therapy can be quite effective in a short period of time."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Friend Expects Me to Solve All His Problems",
    "Question": "I have a close friend who comes to me with all his problems, and sometimes I don’t know how to help. Some small issues I can give advice on or help him out with. When he asks me about other, bigger things, such as work issues, relationship issues, or family issues, I often really don’t know what to do or say.\n\nHe seems to depend on my advice, and if I say “I’m sorry, I don’t know how I can help” or tell him I don’t have a lot of free time at the moment, he will often get irritated and say something like, “Whatever. It doesn’t matter anyway.” Then I find myself trying to reassure him and find a way to help him, even though this takes time and effort I sometimes don’t have.\n\nHe also has a tendency to fixate on things. I’ll offer advice or a suggestion, and he seems to like it, but a few days later he will bring up the issue again, almost as if I said nothing at all. This is very frustrating. If my advice isn’t working out, why doesn’t he seek out someone else’s opinion? I’m only going to tell him the same thing again.\n\nThis happens frequently. We talk most days, and it seems as if a week can’t go by without him having some new problem he needs help with. I don’t mind doing what I can to help, of course, but (1) sometimes it seems like that’s all he wants to talk to me about and (2) I think he can solve most of his problems himself, if he would just give them a little more thought.\n\nI don’t think this is worth losing our friendship over. We have come too far for that. I’ve tried to raise the issue, but he hasn’t seemed to hear what I’m saying. And if I encourage him, saying, “I’m really not sure because I don’t have a lot of experience in that. Try looking it up online!” or something similar, he might respond with “I’m too dumb to figure this out” or make other self-defeating remarks.\n\nDo you have any suggestions as to how I can bring this up and be heard?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you have tried to set some boundaries with your friend and he is unwilling to hear or respect them. That raises the question for me as to what you are getting out of this friendship. You say you’ve “come too far” to lose your friendship, but something in this relationship is not working for you. If your friend is not willing to hear you, or responds with what sounds like emotionally manipulative statements, it may be time to reevaluate just how important this relationship is to you and how staying in it is serving you.\n\nUltimately, if you choose to continue your friendship, it will be up to you to set and hold your boundaries; he is unlikely to change what he is asking of you. You mentioned that when you try to let him know you don’t have answers or it isn’t a good time, you wind up trying to reassure and help him anyhow. One way to stop having him asking for help you can’t or don’t want to give is to stop giving it. Hold firm to your boundary.If the timing is an issue, let him know you aren’t available at the moment, and provide a time that would work for you. He can respond with frustration or anger, but you do not have to give in. You can gently hold your ground and respond with caring. Let him know you are sorry he is struggling and that you will be able to help at another time. If you feel you aren’t the one to help him, that the issues are beyond you, let him know that and then stick to it. If he makes self-deprecating remarks, you do not have to respond to them. When you have given him help and he returns with the same issues again and again, it’s okay to let him know you don’t have anything to add to what you’ve already discussed.\n\nSetting and holding boundaries can be uncomfortable. It is clear you want to be a good friend. Being a good friend does not mean consistently ignoring your needs, however. Being a good friend means not letting resentment build or having frustrations get in the way of your friendship. Being a good friend also means setting limits and not expecting your friend to take full responsibility for holding them.\n\nYou will learn much about your friend and your friendship by how he responds to you when you do hold firm. It may open up a meaningful conversation about the kind of friendship you both want with each other and may even strengthen your friendship. If, however, he is unwilling to recognize your needs as legitimate or your boundaries as meaningful, if he responds to you in anger or with blame or manipulation, I would encourage you to reconsider if this relationship is serving you in a meaningful way.\n\nAs you consider all of this, you may want to get support from a counselor who can help you identify what is keeping you in this relationship; help you implement strategies to set your limits; or, if you should choose to step back from the friendship, help you grieve the loss of what has been an important relationship."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Partner Is Terrible at Communicating",
    "Question": "We’ve been together about a year and a half, and from the beginning we established a mutual dedication to open communication and sharing as much with one another as possible. We weren’t together very long before that started to become challenged. Let me be clear: My girlfriend doesn’t lie to me, doesn’t cheat on me, and I don’t think she even intentionally keeps things from me. She just … doesn’t readily open the doors of communication and isn’t forthcoming with her thoughts or emotions. As someone who likes to talk about my feelings frequently and has heard her say things like “the more information, the better,” I find this incredibly frustrating.\n\nJust in the past month, we have had a significant discussion about how we agree it’s necessary to have difficult conversations, and the sooner the better when an issue or feeling comes up. And that discussion wasn’t even in reaction to any problem that had arisen—we were just positively reaffirming our dedication to such communication. But not two weeks later, she neglected to tell me about receiving a lengthy, heartfelt email from a mutual friend. It contained nothing that crossed boundaries for either of us, but was unusual and deserved attention. I heard about it from the mutual friend before I heard about it from her, however, and it took her a week for her to bring it up on her own. There was no special reason to keep it from me, she said, but she just thought maybe I already knew or she’d wait until she’d responded to let me know about it. She has also been quiet about hanging out with mutual friends when I wasn’t around, even though it’s not something I’m bothered by, and she knows that.\n\nI’m just mystified as to why she continues to make an effort to assure me we have an understanding about mutual, honest, timely communication … and then leave me out of the loop when things happen in her life. It’s a strong disincentive to be open with her, too, and that saddens me. Is there anything we haven’t tried, or any new way I can bring this up to her that encourages her to trust me and talk to me more?",
    "TherapistReply": "I can just feel the intensity of your frustration—it comes through loud and clear in your letter. It sounds like you feel shut out by your girlfriend when all you want is to be deeply and profoundly connected. Beyond frustration, it seems like you feel quite hurt and maybe even alienated by your girlfriend’s lack of communication.\n\nIt sounds to me like there is a mismatch in each of your needs for communication. You seem to crave, and gain a sense of, intimacy from a high degree of communication, while your girlfriend is satisfied by a significantly lower degree of communication. Because you have stated there is no betrayal (i.e., infidelity, crossing boundaries, etc.), it doesn’t seem like the lack of communication on your girlfriend’s part is problematic in and of itself. It doesn’t seem to be rooted in trust issues. The issue seems to be the disparate needs you each have around communication.Framing the issue as a disparate need for communication, as opposed to your girlfriend’s failure to communicate, doesn’t lay the blame at anyone’s feet. It’s just an acknowledgment you have different needs and doesn’t make anyone right or wrong. This can enable both of you to drop your defenses and try to really understand where the other person is coming from.\n\nMuch of how people communicate in intimate relationships is influenced by how they saw their parents communicate. Talking about each of your memories of your parents’ relationships might be a good place to start in trying to understand why each of you have the preferences you have around communication.\n\nYou also mentioned that your girlfriend’s lack of communication is a “strong disincentive” to be open with her. Why is that? There are hints of resentment in this statement, one of the biggest indicators there is work to be done to strengthen your relationship. However you proceed from here, I would encourage you not to let your girlfriend’s communication style dictate yours—especially since you both have expressed “the more, the better” when it comes to sharing.\n\nYou two might also find great value in working with a couples therapist on this issue. A therapist will likely be able to help you two understand each other on a much deeper level. This understanding could lead to a true sense of empathy for each other and quite possibly some movement toward the middle that could work for both of you."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Sister Is Sabotaging My Relationship with My Daughter",
    "Question": "Please help me. I have one sibling, my sister, who has been my closest friend for most of my life. She is two years older than me and newly divorced, with no children. I am married and have one child, my daughter, who means all the world to me and more. We also have always had a very close relationship, but my daughter is 12 and just barely at the age when she ceases to believe her mother walks on water … if you get my drift. She doesn’t hate me, but she does look for any reason to say I’m being “unfair” with rules or to push my buttons. Unfortunately, her aunt (my sister) only seems to egg her on.\n\nAt some point, when my daughter was maybe 6 or 7, it started feeling like my sister and daughter were ganging up on me. They’d giggle together when I dropped something in the kitchen or tease me when I misspoke by accident—little stuff like that. But the teasing started to get more vicious, and my daughter started initiating it after a while. My husband and I were completely shocked, because this behavior was completely at odds with everything we have tried to teach her over her entire life! I started noticing it got worse when she came back from staying with my sister, which happens at least once every couple weeks. Sometimes we were able to sit her down and ask her about it, and she would realize why her comments were rude and disrespectful. But it’s gotten more and more difficult to have those conversations with her.\n\nMeanwhile, my sister has gotten worse about staying in touch and being there for my parents. She’s still one of my best friends, but I am very suspicious of her behavior with my daughter and her lack of communication. All she seems to contact me for these days is asking to see my daughter, and my daughter is just as enthusiastic about spending time with her. I’ve been sympathetic and accommodating, especially since my sister’s divorce. I know she is lonely and has always wanted a child of her own. Plus, I know it can be important for kids to develop relationships with adults in the family—even if it means there’s a “fun aunt” and I am resigned to being the maternal rule enforcer.\n\nBut this situation is way more than that. My daughter seems far more invested in her friendship with my sister than being a respectful child. Sometimes she even talks about living with her aunt full-time and says the only thing keeping her at home is her dad. It’s breaking my heart to see her so poorly influenced by my sister, but I know the worst thing would be to separate them completely, because then they’d both hate me. I have no idea what to do! Can you help me understand why my sister might be taking her jealousy (or whatever this is) out on me so cruelly? I hate the feeling they’re teaming up against me, and worried about the future of my family and my daughter’s wrath. What can I do to salvage the solid foundation I thought I’d built in my family and deal with whatever is going on with my sister?",
    "TherapistReply": "This must be so painful on many levels. Feeling like you are losing both your sister and your daughter just hurts. Some of what is happening is developmentally expected, but the specific concerns with your sister seem to be complicating matters.\n\nFirst, I’d like to address what often happens with a 12-year-old child. Part of the pre-adolescent/adolescent developmental task is about exploring identity. For most, this means a separation-individuation process that often defines the self in opposition to the parent(s). Many times, this is more intense with the parent of the same gender. As your daughter figures out what kind of woman she wants to become, it may begin with defining herself in opposition to the woman you are. Knowing this is natural doesn’t make it less hurtful, but hopefully makes it feel a little less personal.\n\nDuring this time, having a caring adult—like an aunt—can be a hugely important way for a child to continue to receive love and guidance from a responsible adult (hopefully one with good boundaries who is in communication with you). That can help a pre-teen/teen navigate the confusing period of adolescence in healthy ways. One tremendously frustrating experience most parents share is having their child ignore the advice and wisdom offered by parents (who clearly don’t know ANYTHING) only to listen with rapt attention to the very same words of wisdom when presented from another source. That’s where aunts, uncles, coaches, or mentors can be invaluable. What is not helpful is having an adult who feeds into the rejection of the parent, triangulates, or attempts to be a “best friend” rather than a caring, responsible adult.If your sister were simply being a safe sounding board for your daughter to express frustration, she could be a great support. If, however, she hears your daughter’s complaints about you and encourages or adds to the negative talk, it can be damaging all around. It’s one thing to hear your daughter’s complaints and reply with “That must be so frustrating!” It is another to reply with “Oh, I know, you should have seen her when …” The first is an empathetic response that creates a place of safety for your child. The second, while it might feel good for a moment for your daughter (and sister), may actually make her feel less safe talking with your sister in the long run. Many adults fall into this trap of thinking the best way to connect to adolescents is as a friend, which simply isn’t so. Kids need boundaries to push against. They need adults to be adults. They rarely recognize it consciously, but they often feel safest with adults who hold those boundaries (like maternal rule enforcers).\n\nYou are right that simply forbidding your daughter and sister from having a relationship could be damaging to all your relationships; however, you are well within your rights as a mom to set out some clear guidelines for your sister. You might begin by letting her know how glad you are that she loves your daughter and wants to be a support to her. You then may want to explore with her what you each hope that relationship would look like. This is the time to be open and honest about your fears and concerns for your daughter and set some boundaries. It is okay to listen to her frustrations with you. It is not okay to add to them. You can limit or curtail the time they spend together if she is unwilling to respect those boundaries, much like you would with anyone whose interactions with your child could be harmful.\n\nYou ask why your sister is “taking her jealousy out … on (you) so cruelly.” I’m not sure that’s what is happening. It may not have anything to do with you and everything to do with her. Trying to get on the same page about what is best for your daughter—without making your hurt feelings the focus of this conversation—is likely to be more productive. It sounds, however, like having a future conversation about the relationship the two of you have and hope to have would be fruitful; I recommend keeping it separate from the conversation about your daughter.\n\nIf your sister is willing, you might consider meeting with a counselor to talk about the various issues you mention in your relationship, including your feelings about how she is showing up for you and for your parents. It may also be helpful to work with someone on how each of you can support your daughter, and each other, in the coming years."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Stop Grinding My Teeth? Is It Due to Anxiety?",
    "Question": "For years now, I’ve had a problem with grinding my teeth, and it only seems to be getting worse. I think it might be hereditary because my mom says she grinds her teeth, too. It used to only happen at night, but lately it’s almost constant, and I have to consciously stop myself from clenching my jaw even during normal daily tasks (like writing this letter, for example).\n\nI know things like biting cheeks and the skin on your lips can be linked to anxiety or other mental health issues. Is it the same with grinding teeth or jaw clenching? So far, amazingly, my dentist says my teeth haven’t been affected too much—but they always still try to sell me on expensive mouth guards. I’ve tried store-bought mouth guards and had a retainer for a while, but obviously they’re not really stopping the jaw tension even if they’re protecting my teeth. Sometimes I fall asleep biting my tongue and wake up with really pronounced indents from my molars. And I think sometimes the tension is related to how stressful my dreams are. But I don’t always remember my dreams, so I can’t say for sure.\n\nAnyway, do you have any suggestions for things I can try? I wake up with a dull headache from this nearly every morning, and I’d really like to stop popping painkillers. I do think I have a more-stressful-than-average life, but honestly I prefer staying busy, and I don’t think my stress level is likely to change. Besides, I know people who lead lives with far more responsibilities and stress who don’t have this issue. Any ideas?",
    "TherapistReply": "You’re not alone in this! Many people grind or clench their teeth, often in their sleep but also often in the daytime as well. Fortunately, there are many things you can try to help yourself overcome this issue and prevent more significant damage as a result of teeth grinding. I will provide some suggestions of things you can do, but first I’ll share a little more information about grinding teeth, how and why it happens and persists, and the role of anxiety in clenching or grinding teeth.\n\nClenching or grinding teeth without awareness, also known as bruxism, affects many (the incidence at any one time is around 10% of the population) and can range in severity from mild (no physical evidence of consequences) to severe. More notable effects of grinding or clenching include facial pain, tired jaw muscles or the development of jaw disorders, sensitive or damaged teeth, damage to tongue or inside of mouth walls, headaches, or earaches. It has been found to happen more frequently during periods of high stress, though it can become habitual and happen regardless of stress level. It also appears to have a hereditary link and happens more frequently in women than men.Does this mean you have anxiety? It’s hard to accurately assess that without information that can only be gleaned by talking to you in person. I recommend making an appointment with a therapist near you to discuss the issues you may be experiencing.\n\nCertainly, grinding or clenching teeth can be one manifestation of holding tension and responding to stress, and many individuals who experience anxiety (and depression) do also grind their teeth. Grinding teeth does not necessarily mean you are experiencing anxiety (or depression), however. That said, one way to treat this is by using many of the same behavioral techniques you might use to help manage anxiety.The first step in overcoming grinding or clenching teeth is to become aware of the issue. How did you discover you were doing this? Have you experienced headaches or tightness in your facial muscles? Has your dentist remarked about damaged teeth or suspect you might be grinding or clenching? Are you hearing from your partner that you are grinding teeth in your sleep? Ask yourself questions about the frequency and nature of this behavior. When are you grinding or clenching your teeth? Are you doing other activities at the same time (e.g., sleeping or working)? Do you notice you are feeling stressed when you are clenching your teeth? You may want to keep a journal for a period of time to track this behavior and when it occurs. This information can inform your strategies to help overcome these behaviors.Essentially, a pattern has developed over time. For example, you have trained yourself to engage in teeth clenching if you automatically start clenching your jaw when doing things like typing on your keyboard or stepping out into the winter cold. Now is the time to break this habit, before you notice more significant consequences.\n\nBe aware of your mouth position. Believe it or not, there is a correct way to position your jaw. With your lips closed, you want to keep a gap between your top and bottom jaw, which can he assisted by placing the tip of your tongue just behind your front teeth on top. This may take some practice and regularly checking in to modify your habit of how you typically position your mouth. If, as you are reading this, you notice you are clenching your jaw, start to make a change. Begin by opening your mouth as if you are about scream, which is a great stretch for these muscles, followed by adopting the correct mouth position. This correct position will likely reduce tension in the jaw.How do you know whether you are holding tension in your body? It is not always obvious. One thing to do is to scan your body for tension. Deliberately think about every muscle group in your body. Are muscles in your back or shoulders holding tension? Muscles in your jaw? Take a deep breath in and exhale. Let go of the tension where you notice you are holding it. Various relaxation techniques, centered on mindful breathing, can be especially effective. You may want to end every day by scanning your body for tension. You may want to do some yoga stretches. Additionally, try placing a warm washcloth on the muscles of your jaw to relax them before bedtime.\n\nThere are some suggested “don’ts” as well. Because this is a habit, be mindful of nonfood items you may “chew” on. Chewing pencils, straws, toothpicks, etc. may increase your tendency to engage in that behavior when you are not aware of it. Be aware of your chewing all around. Also, some experts would recommend reducing caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol before bed.\n\nOther strategies to consider are what your dentist has been suggesting to you. If relaxation strategies and retraining your behavioral patterns are not the approach you would like to try, many individuals do utilize bite plates and find that custom plates are useful. If you are reluctant to try this approach, first try the behavioral strategies suggested above.\n\nKnowing potential damages or consequences can be enough to motivate many to try to make a change. It sounds like you are quite motivated to overcome this on your own. Good luck!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Will a Therapist Tell My Parents About Self-Harm?",
    "Question": "I am under 18 and live with my dad and stepmom. I’ve been cutting for almost a year from depression and anxiety and basically not feeling like I want to be here. I HATE the idea of seeing a therapist and “talking about my feelings,” but apparently the school counselor told my dad I needed to see someone outside the school for help. The school counselor doesn’t know about the cutting, but I’ve talked to him a bit because apparently I have “anger issues.”\n\nSo now my dad and stepmother are looking up therapists for me to go see. I really don’t want to talk to anyone about my “issues,” but it’s getting hard to cover the marks on my arms and legs and I don’t know how to stop cutting. And also I know they’re just going to keep me in therapy longer if I refuse to talk. But I REALLY don’t want my parents to know about me cutting myself or the suicidal thoughts I sometimes have. Can I get through counseling without my parents finding out about it? How much is the counselor going to tell my parents about what I say in therapy?",
    "TherapistReply": "These are good questions to ask any therapist you see. Find out from them what their policies are regarding confidentiality with people in therapy under 18. Much of what they say will depend on legal and ethical guidelines based on where they live and what kind of license they have. When I work with people under the age of 18, I discuss in great detail with both the young person and the parents what those guidelines are. That allows everyone to have the same understanding and expectation about how the process works. It also allows the young person to decide how much to share with me and to be aware of what my responsibilities to report are.\n\nMost professionals are obligated to report when a person in therapy, regardless of age, is in imminent danger. That danger could be significant risk of suicide or conditions of abuse/neglect. Thoughts of suicide alone, however, do not necessarily trigger a mandated report—it depends on the circumstances. There are many people who have such thoughts but no intention or plan on following through. What is essential, however, is that anyone who is struggling with thoughts of suicide finds sources of support with whom they can talk. A trusted therapist is a great option. There are also national hotlines where you can reach out for support 24/7.I’ve worked with a number of people who also HATED the idea of talking about their feelings. Usually that stems from a place of fearing they would be judged, a massive discomfort with feeling vulnerable and exposed, and a reluctance to trust someone they don’t know well. All of those feelings are natural. I can share with you that all of those people, in their own time, came to trust me and the process. When you find a therapist you can work with, who allows you to share at your own pace, who offers you a safe place to speak your truth without fear of being judged, counseling can be an amazing experience.\n\nIf I can offer you a suggestion, don’t reject therapy completely because it feels like something being “done” to you. I hear the frustration in your message about all that the adults in your world “apparently” believe to be true for you. Instead, look at what YOU can get out of this experience. You can have a voice and share your truth with someone. You can get support for the anger, anxiety, and depression you say you’ve been feeling for a year now. You can have support in finding alternative strategies beyond cutting to cope with the intensity of the feelings you have. You can be seen. You can be heard.\n\nNobody can make you share what you aren’t willing to share. You are right, though, that refusing to talk or engage will likely limit your choices and your control over your situation. So, how can you engage in ways that work for you? Ask your potential therapist the tough questions about confidentiality and how they manage those issues. Find out if your parents are willing to let you take part in the process of choosing a therapist. Many professionals have directory profiles and websites that can tell you a bit about what they might be like to work with. I’ve had people meet me first before deciding to work with me. Many therapists are very willing to meet to assess fit, as we know a good fit leads to more positive outcomes. You might just find someone you can open up to who can offer relief from what you’ve been feeling."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Afraid of Everything!",
    "Question": "I’m afraid of everything. I seriously mean everything. Spiders, clowns, heights, germs, dying, dogs, small spaces, large crowds, undercooked meats, darkness, terrorist attacks, natural disasters … I could go on. These irrational fears have been affecting my life for as long as I can remember, and I never seem to get over them. If anything, I only find new things I’m afraid of.\n\nI did a ton of research to find a place to live that was least risky—no hurricanes, no tornadoes, unlikely earthquakes, the least number of bugs, etc. I’ve insulated myself as much as humanly possible. I’m still miserable and afraid.\n\nOnly a small number of these fears actually have roots in personal experiences. For instance, I was once bitten by a large dog, which explains my fear of dogs. But I have never been traumatized by a clown, never been caught in a violent attack, never experienced a natural disaster. I never had a negative experience in an elevator, but I have a panic attack almost every time I step foot in one.\n\nWhy do these things bother me so much? Is it possible to “cure” fears that have no basis in personal history? I want to live more freely and feel better about normal things and occurrences that should, at most, evoke minimal discomfort. Please help!",
    "TherapistReply": "You write that you are scared of everything and there is no reason for most of your fears. I disagree. I think you do have reasons, even if you may not be fully aware of them, and these reasons can be worked with.\n\nSure, if you’ve been bitten by a dog, it makes logical sense you’d be afraid of dogs—there’s a reason for the saying “once bitten, twice shy,” after all. But you don’t have to have been in an elevator, necessarily, to be afraid of elevators—claustrophobia (fear of being trapped in small places) and agoraphobia (fear of situations that might cause panic and feelings of helplessness) are both pretty common.\n\nSome of the other fears you describe—fear of spiders (arachnophobia), fear of heights (acrophobia), fear of germs (mysophobia), fear of clowns (coulrophobia), fear of dying (thanatophobia), and fear of earthquakes (seismophobia)—are prevalent enough to have their own names, too.It’s telling to me that you describe your fears as irrational. If you look at these fears, you no doubt recognize they are about things and events that do sometimes happen or present problems in human experience, but remember: the brain is wired to protect itself. Consider your fear of dying, for instance. Would you agree most people fear death on some level? Fundamentally, fear of death is protective, as it is our brain telling us to make decisions that are in the best interests of its preservation. Your brain is in fact being rational, not irrational, when it tells you to, say, keep your distance from the edge of the cliff, or to slow down, or to not eat those two-week-old leftovers. (Thanks, brain!)Some of these fears can also go along with emotional experiences—claustrophobia, for example, can be linked to early experiences. You may not have been stuck in an elevator at any point, but you may have a history of being stuck or trapped in other, perhaps figurative, more emotional ways. As a result, seeking and finding safety may have become paramount in your life. Based on the extent of your fears and the lengths to which you go to avoid feeling fearful, I imagine that being vulnerable—as we all are in one way or another—is not something that sits especially well with you.\n\nCan you do anything about being fearful? Well, yes. I think your best bet would be to seek a therapist who specializes in helping people with anxiety, fear, and worry. Starting therapy can be scary too, of course, but working with someone who is grounded, accepting, and knowledgeable about how to help people in your situation is a fine step toward learning how to handle your feelings.\n\nYou say you’ve “insulated” yourself as much as “humanly possible,” but you are still afraid and “miserable.” Clearly, the actions you’ve taken to protect yourself, while well-intentioned, aren’t working for you. You yearn for some relief. You ask whether there is a cure. That’s a strong word, and while nothing is guaranteed, I feel confident in saying therapy can help you understand your fears better, which in turn may help you manage them in more effective and productive ways.\n\nI salute you for identifying an issue that is blocking you. You’ve taken a fine first step by writing in and explaining your situation. I wish you well as you take the next step in addressing your fears by partnering with a qualified mental health professional."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Convince a Parent to Go to Therapy?",
    "Question": "My mom is nearing 70. She was widowed four years ago, and ever since then she seems to have given up on life. She barely leaves her house, doesn’t want to socialize or make friends, and has even started smoking again, despite being a lung cancer survivor. She falls asleep in her chair at 3 a.m., sleeps until after noon, feeds her dogs, then watches TV the rest of the day and night. She used to love cooking; now she eats cereal for dinner half the time. She used to love sewing; her sewing machine is collecting dust. She used to have many friends; some have died off, some are out of state, and she has no motivation to seek more. Yet she professes that she is lonely. Well, do something about it! Instead, she relies more on her children and guilt trips us if we don’t meet her needs—if we don’t call all the time or visit, to her we don’t care. (None of her kids live within an hour’s drive and we all have demanding jobs and families.)\n\nI’ve done some reading and I think she’s clearly depressed. I know she feels like her life has been gutted now that her husband isn’t in it. She has no one to take care of anymore, and probably feels a lack of purpose. That’s why my siblings and I are so adamant that finding one would be in her best interests: volunteer, go to church … something! But she refuses.\n\nI really think therapy would benefit her, but (as you might imagine) she is opposed to the idea, saying there is nothing wrong with her. I tried to tell her that going to therapy doesn’t mean there’s necessarily something wrong with her, that it can support her healing from her grief and move on with her life, but she just isn’t buying it. I tell her that moving forward and living her life is what her husband would have wanted, and she agrees, but nothing ever happens. She is very set in her ways. I feel helpless, like I am watching my mother die right before my eyes. And I am angry she won’t help herself, since she is the only one who can. Any suggestions or advice for me?",
    "TherapistReply": "The sadness, anger, and helplessness you feel are palpable. You are clearly very concerned about your mother, and based on your description of her, it does seem possible she is depressed and she might very well benefit from therapy. You can see all of this quite clearly, but she cannot—and that must be quite frustrating for you.I wonder if engaging in your own therapy could be helpful for you. I imagine the feeling of “watching your mother die right before your eyes” evokes many feelings, even beyond feelings of concern for your mother’s health and well-being. You are likely dealing with your own feelings of loss of the woman your mother once was, and looking to the future with concern about your actual loss of her through death. Sometimes, these kinds of experiences can also raise feelings about your own mortality.\n\nIt also sounds like you are trying to change your mother’s behavior. While it is certainly understandable to want better for her, you cannot force her to do anything. Trying to force someone to do something, even if it is something that would be good for them, is almost always a recipe for frustration. Engaging in your own therapy might be helpful in accepting that no matter what you do, your mom might not seek therapy or take steps to heal. Once you accept that you cannot make your mom get well, you may be better able to identify what you can do to help her, and more comfortable stopping there and leaving it in her hands.\n\nIt sounds like your mom is expecting you and your siblings to do a lot, maybe more than is reasonable. When you’re unable to be what she needs at any given time, the “guilt-tripping” you describe can be a lot to bear. If you do, in fact, feel any guilt—reasonably or otherwise—therapy may also help you deal with that, along with any resentment the guilt-tripping behavior might elicit.\n\nFinally, engaging in your own therapy might be helpful for your mom, too. You could be a good model of a healthy, functional person seeking therapy simply because you are struggling through a difficult life situation and trying to find ways to cope with it. You could talk to her about the value you find in therapy and how it helps you. She might even see it in potential changes in the way you relate to her.\n\nI wish you peace and healing in this very difficult time."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Worried About My Child’s Aggressive Play",
    "Question": "My 5-year-old is a generally happy and sweet kid, but I have been noticing lately that her play can get pretty violent. She can be aggressive sometimes and say things like, “Let’s pretend to punch each other.” When we play together, she wants there to be “good guys” and “bad guys” and have them fight—and sometimes kill—each other. She builds guns and other weapons with Legos and uses them to have fights with her toys, gleefully informing me when one or another of her toys “dies.”\n\nHer dad and I don’t let her watch violent shows, so I don’t know where she is getting this—from other kids at school or from watching shows at her grandparents’ house, maybe? I’m worried whatever exposure she’s getting to weapons and violence is going to be harmful. I’ve tried to talk with her about it, but I’m not sure I’m using the right words. It’s really difficult for me to hear her play-act violence without saying anything, but I don’t want her to think she’s being “bad,” because I know she isn’t. How can I talk to her about this?",
    "TherapistReply": "As a therapist, I want to let you know that this experience is common, and, actually, developmentally appropriate. As a parent, however, I remember being concerned myself when my happy (sheltered) kid started playing in this way. It may be that your daughter is hearing or watching kids on the playground, or perhaps has seen shows, but often it is hard to pinpoint a specific source of inspiration. Many kids, at some point, explore themes of aggression, violence, and death through their play.\n\nI think in all of this it can be helpful to remember the true function of play. Children play to explore their world, to experience in fantasy things they might not experience in real life, and to try things out safely. It is not unusual for kids, particularly rule-following kids, to embrace the role of “bad guy” in their play. For young children who are not often in control of their world, what greater relief and excitement is there than to play-act as the ultimate rule-breakers? Also, children are naturally curious about life and death and how everything works. Play-acting the death of their toys is one way they process safely any fears or concerns they might have or try to make a big concept feel controllable.There’s also a somewhat innate destructive urge that can be seen in any toddler on a beach relishing their demolition of a sand castle. The glee you describe in your little girl may simply be a reflection of the joy of being in complete control of her universe. She is all-powerful. How fun is that? As long as these impulses are expressed through play and not manifesting in aggressive, hurtful behavior beyond playtime, there is likely little to be concerned about.\n\nYou are right not to want her to think she is being “bad” by engaging in this play. One helpful approach is to express curiosity. For example, you might ask her why she wants to pretend to “punch each other.” You can engage in some complicated, choreographed, slow-motion “fights” that could actually be fun and enjoyable for both of you, while talking with her about why you would never actually harm each other in real life. You can also ask her what happens to a toy when it “dies” and explore her understanding of what that means. Asking her to tell you what it means to be a “bad guy” or a “good guy” can give you some insight into her developing sense of morality—and even if she chooses to be the “bad guy” in play, that doesn’t mean she actually embraces the dark side.\n\nIt is natural as a parent to worry about all that our children will be exposed to when they are not in our care, and yet, as they get older, more and more of their time will be spent beyond the walls of our homes. We can’t prevent them from hearing and seeing things we might not like. What we can do is equip them to handle their experiences. Ongoing conversations about what we believe is important, how we believe we should treat people, and what impact our words and actions have on others around us can help our children navigate the various messages they receive.\n\nIf your child remains generally happy, sweet, loving, and able to express empathy, it is likely she is using this play in healthy, developmentally appropriate ways. It is also likely a phase that will pass. If, however, you see some concerning behaviors going beyond the scope of play, you may want to consult with a child therapist to address those concerns. Your child’s teacher can also be a great source of information about how your daughter’s behavior at school compares with what you see at home, as well putting it in context with the other 5-year-olds in her school."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m a Natural Flirt, but It’s Hurting My Partner",
    "Question": "My husband and I have been together for five years and have a great marriage that includes a very satisfying and active sex life. I’ve never cheated on him, and to my knowledge he’s always been faithful to me. But I have always been a natural flirt. It’s almost instinctive. The words come out of my mouth before I even realize what they are sometimes, and I’ll touch someone’s arm or shoulder before I even realize I’ve done it.\n\nPart of it is that I’m a social butterfly, and my ease in relating to others has won me a lot of friends over the years. But the flirting gets me into trouble sometimes, and I’m not sure what to do about it. Don’t get me wrong: I flirt with my husband more than anyone. But I also flirt with other men (and even women sometimes) in front of him, and while he never said much about it in our first couple of years together, he tends to point it out a lot now, and has admitted it bothers him.\n\nI want to respect my husband’s feelings, and I really don’t mean to hurt him. At the same time, by stifling what comes naturally to me, even when the flirting is innocuous, I feel like I am stifling an essential part of my personality. What can I do to reconcile this?",
    "TherapistReply": "So your flirtatious behavior is hurtful to your partner, you know it, and you’re doing it anyway. What is the possible “disaster” you allude to? Is it breaking up with your husband or something else?\n\nYou say the flirting is innocuous, but I’m not so sure it is if it gets you into trouble with your husband. Accurate or not, from your words it sounds a bit like you’re looking for trouble.\n\nFlirting comes naturally for you, and you feel you would be “stifling an essential part” of your personality if you didn’t flirt. Is it possible that using the label “natural flirt” to describe yourself—which sounds like talking up an enviable talent or skill—is a way for you to downplay the behavior and its potential ramifications? Being good at something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good thing to do.\n\nYou say you are a social butterfly and thus have a lot of friends. That is a good thing. How would you describe the “butterfly” part of yourself? Where does it come from? Do social butterflies always flirt? What would you lose if you didn’t flirt the way you do? Would people still like you and want to be around you?\n\nYou say the words sometimes come out of your mouth before you know you’re saying them. That can certainly lead to disaster. It might be worthwhile, in social situations, to train yourself to pause and think before you speak. I’d venture to say social success goes beyond the simple measures of how effortlessly you banter or many people you attract. Considering the implications of your words and behaviors before they become actions is an essential part of effective communication.\n\nI don’t know much about you from your letter, but I have worked with people in therapy for whom flirting was a way of feeling close, reassured, important, and loved by others. It’s possible to have many friends and be lonely in certain ways. If I were your therapist, I would explore this possibility with you to see whether there might be some loneliness—perhaps emotional or existential rather than physical in nature—under the surface of your behavior.I’m not your therapist, of course, so I urge you to work with a therapist near you who can help you get to the root of all this. It may also be worthwhile to see a marriage counselor with your husband, as couples counseling can help you both open up safely and understand each other better. Sometimes, the most important part of communication is simply feeling heard, and therapy creates an impartial space for that to happen.\n\nYou write that your husband has admitted your flirting bothers him. You also write that you flirt with others in front of him, which doesn’t sound innocuous. He may feel belittled. Many people wouldn’t like being in that position. Perhaps your aim is to tease him? If it is, does he know that? Does it matter?\n\nWhat does his anger mean to you? Does it make you mad at him? Do you resent him or feel he’s overreacting? Do you listen, acknowledge his feelings, and pledge to honor them? Where do things go off track?\n\nI guess I’m concerned that flirting with others is already causing problems in your marriage, and those problems may grow. It’s easier to work on problems before they get too big, or entrenched, in a relationship. Relationship problems tend to worsen if they are not addressed. Where might that lead in your case?\n\nDo I sound a little extreme? Maybe. But something in what you’re not saying makes me hear an alarm bell going off between the lines.\n\nThank you for writing bravely and honestly about this issue and how you’re contributing to it. I hope you find a solution, perhaps with the help of counseling, so that you and your husband can enjoy many mutually happy years together."

    "QuestionTitle": "Do I Need to Give My Kids an Allowance?",
    "Question": "My oldest child is 7, and many of his friends receive an allowance from their parents for doing chores around the house. I never gave the idea of an allowance much thought, as I didn’t receive an allowance for chores as a kid and don’t personally feel it’s necessary. But seeing his peers spend money and buy things for themselves (nothing major, just small toys or candy) makes my son want the same freedom. Plus, I’m facing a shocking amount of criticism from other parents in my son’s friend circle. I had no idea this was such a contentious issue! Those parents all say that giving an allowance teaches kids the importance of earning money through hard work, as well as the value of saving money, spending it wisely, etc.\n\nOf course, like any parent, I do see the merit of providing an incentive for tasks, especially when so often it’s like pulling teeth to even get them to put a dish in the sink. But I also feel strongly that chores are not the type of labor that deserves a reward, since contributing to household duties is something they will have to do their whole lives without compensation. In many ways, I feel like offering an allowance is instilling in them the idea that they’re entitled to payment for doing chores that are not above and beyond the scope of expected responsibilities.\n\nIs there an argument for or against an allowance from a long-term mental health standpoint? Or is there a certain age when it’s better to introduce an allowance system? I know in the grand scheme of parenting the issue of an allowance, either issued or withheld, probably will not “make or break” a kid. Just curious whether you have any insights about lasting lessons a child might learn one way or the other. Thanks!",
    "TherapistReply": "This is such a great parenting question!\n\nThe first part I’d like to address is the criticism you are getting from peers. You are entitled to make parenting choices that work for you and your family that are aligned with your family’s unique values. The judgment you are feeling from the other parents is unfortunate—and ultimately their issue, not yours.\n\nI’d also like to separate the two issues of chores and allowance. Chores are great for kids, assuming they are age-appropriate. They teach competence, life skills, and the importance of contributing to the family (something that combats entitlement and enhances gratitude). It is absolutely okay to expect your children, even as young as 3 or 4, to contribute to the household by picking up, feeding animals, setting and clearing the table, and other achievable tasks.\n\nYou are also correct that combining allowance and chores can be problematic. It shifts the focus from contributing to the family as an expectation, or social relationship, to a fee for service, or business relationship. What happens if your child feels he doesn’t need the money? Does that excuse him from feeding the dog? Combining the two also runs the risk of fostering a sense of entitlement—I’ve heard many kids, when asked to do something for their parents, ask, “What will you give me?” If they have been trained to believe task equals payment, this reaction is to be expected. An allowance, however, is also pretty terrific for children. It teaches them the value of money. It gives them some independence. It allows them to contribute financially to gifts for friends or family and feel some pride and ownership. It also encourages them to learn about decision-making and delayed gratification. If they want a toy that costs $15, do they want to spend their savings on trinkets that cost $2,if they know it will delay their ultimate goal?\n\nAllowances also encourage conversations about values. Some parents set up a system by which kids put money in spend-save-share jars. The share part is for donating to a cause of their choice. If that is something you want to encourage, there’s no better way to teach that lesson than having them involved in deciding what to give and to whom.\n\nThe allowance does not have to be exorbitant. It does not need to match what your child’s peers are getting. There will be plenty of times over the course of your parenting life when your children will compare their treatment to that of their peers (today, allowance—soon, phones and cars). You are under no obligation to match what their peers or peers’ parents are doing. However, conversations with your children about why you are making the decisions you are making will help them develop a keener understanding of your family values and priorities.I hear your struggle with incentivizing chores. Some parents choose to make chores a basic expectation (this is what we do). Failing to meet those expectations results in losses of privileges (screen time, dessert, play dates, etc.). There are also ways to encourage chores by instilling in your children a sense of pride of accomplishment. Letting my son hear me brag to friends and family about how well he did his “jobs” without prompting has accomplished far more than any sticker chart or reward system ever did.\n\nYou are right that this is not a “make-or-break” kind of parenting decision. It is, however, a tremendous opportunity to intentionally foster the skills and values you hope your children will possess as adults. If you want to read more about this topic, there’s a fantastic book by Ron Lieber called The Opposite of Spoiled. It delves into all of this and more and is incredibly informative and accessible."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Family Doesn’t Approve of My Relationship",
    "Question": "I’ve been seeing this wonderful girl for over three years now, and my parents still have not warmed up to her. She and I are a perfect fit, very compatible, but not too similar. We introduce one another to new experiences, resolve our differences pretty well, and have fun together. It seems like the only piece missing is the fact my parents—whole family, really—don’t approve. They’re nice enough when we’re all together and have never been cruel to her outright, but my sister has made comments on the side about how I “could do better,” and my dad says vaguely insulting things like, “I always pictured you with someone … different.” I’ve also heard them mock her voice and make some jokes at her expense.\n\nI’ve never asked what, exactly, they find fault with, but if I had to register a guess it would be that my girlfriend didn’t go to college and has a nontraditional job. She’s not a deadbeat, by any means, and she’s still one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. She just doesn’t fit their view of what a well-educated person on a definite career track looks like. Otherwise, she blends very well with my family in terms of humor, ideology, political beliefs—pretty much any category that actually matters.\n\nI really, really want to marry this woman, and could see myself popping the question in the next six months to a year, except that I desperately want my family on my side when I do. We’re a relatively small, tight-knit group, and it’s important to me that they at least see my love for her and understand she’s here to stay. Does this require a family meeting-type scenario to iron out our differences? Or should I just forge ahead and hope they jump on board and become supportive soon?",
    "TherapistReply": "This is quite the dilemma. It sounds like you have found a partner with whom you’d like to build a life. While this is a beautiful thing, it is complicated by your family’s less-than-enthusiastic embrace of her. I imagine this leaves you feeling pulled between the people you love most.\n\nI’m curious about how you have handled the times when your sister declares that you can do better or your dad says he imagined you with someone else. Do you push back against this and let them know this is a woman you love deeply and with whom you can imagine spending your life? If you have not, I wonder if talking to them about how serious you are about this woman and how unacceptable you find their remarks to be would sufficiently address the issue. Perhaps if they knew she was here to stay and you wouldn’t accept them being unkind to her, they would realize they needed to get on board, as you say.I find myself wondering if your girlfriend is aware of your family’s lukewarm feelings toward her. If she is aware, how does she feel about it? Does this cause any conflict between the two of you in your relationship? If she is aware of their feelings, perhaps a “family meeting-type scenario,” including her, as you suggest could be helpful for everyone involved. You may even want to enlist the help of a family therapist to help everyone talk through the conflict.\n\nI’m also curious about the dynamics in your family. Is your sister in a serious relationship? Are you the first to try to bring someone new into the family? For some families, this can feel threatening in a sense. They might even see her introduction to the scene as a threat to your place in their lives.\n\nHopefully, through some conversations with your family, possibly including your girlfriend and/or a family therapist, everyone can come together. If not, you might need to decide how to proceed with your relationship with your girlfriend without your family’s support. These situations can be very painful, and you might find it helpful to partner with a therapist to help you process your feelings and determine the best course of action."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Overcome the Shame of Sex?",
    "Question": "I grew up in a fairly religious household where sex was rarely discussed (and when it was, it was talked about for the purposes of conception). Now, in my 30s, I have renounced many aspects of the religion I grew up with and come to realize some of the harm it caused in my life—including giving me a very problematic view of sex.\n\nI’m a virgin and have barely even been able to masturbate, let alone approach intimacy with a partner. I feel ashamed and guilty whenever I try, even though I tell myself over and over again that self-exploration is healthy and necessary. I desperately want a relationship, too, but can’t fathom the idea of overcoming my nervousness about sex and exposing my body (nudity was condemned in my family as well).\n\nWhile I am still a child of God and am waiting for marriage to have sex, I would like to be more open to physical acts of love and more self-accepting when it comes to touching myself. Can you tell me why shame and embarrassment persist around the subject of sex, even after I have released so much other negativity that was ingrained in me through my childhood faith? How can I shake the bad emotions that arise instantly when I feel aroused or try to indulge my thoughts and fantasies about sex?",
    "TherapistReply": "First off, I want to say how much I respect and admire you. Clearly, you have worked hard to release the “negativity” that was part of your childhood. That is a huge undertaking, and you have accomplished a great deal. Nevertheless, you want to go further. You write that although you have achieved great self-understanding, there is an important aspect of your life that you would like to change—shame about sex.\n\nYou write that you feel ashamed and guilty about your sexuality. Shame and guilt are both powerful emotions, but very different from each other. Guilt has to do with feeling bad about something you have done. It’s hard to endure, but shame is worse. Shame is about who you are or, more accurately, who you think you are (based on the influences in your life)—no good, bad, worthless, and so on. If you feel guilty about something you have done, you can make retribution or decide to never repeat the action. But shame? Shame is about your core being, your whole self, body, and soul. I get the feeling from your words that shaming might have been part of your experiences growing up. Shame is used to belittle and control people; it is a tool of hate, not of love.\n\nYou describe sex as almost a great unmentionable in your childhood home, surrounded by prohibitions about nudity, masturbation, and adult relationships. Sexuality has something to do with love and loving, because sex is, finally, a loving physical and emotional expression of closeness with oneself and another. In fact, sexuality is an integral and intimate part of a person’s very being—and being in loving connection, the very opposite of shame.\n\nYou write that you are a “child of God.” I don’t know how you express your spirituality, but I wonder if you have come across this quotation from Ephesians 5:20: “For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as the Messiah does the church.” In short, take care of yourself, body and soul, with complete love.\n\nI recognize—and maybe you do, too—that this sounds easier said than done. For many people, the shame they experience surrounding sex stems from societal and religious taboos that have developed over many generations, making it a particularly difficult subject to reconcile new feelings around. I urge you to be compassionate with yourself as you work through your feelings, which clearly aren’t comfortable for you. It’s hard to overcome a lifetime of conditioning.I find myself wondering how you care for yourself. Do you provide yourself with proper rest and physical care? Do you beautify yourself and your environment? Do things you like? Do you recognize and then give yourself what you need? Respecting, caring for, and loving oneself may gradually bring you closer to your body. Again, be kind to yourself.\n\nMany people experience negative feelings about the body. You wonder how you might overcome yours. I would start by working with a therapist around issues of loving yourself, emotionally as well as physically. Therapy can be very helpful as you gradually unlearn the negative feelings that are attached to your sexuality. The experience of talking about your feelings with a compassionate other may itself be a way to lessen your feelings of shame as you bring them to light on your terms. This is a gradual process. There is no hurry.\n\nYou might also find physical outlets, such as sports or yoga or hiking, for example, that you enjoy. These are ways to perhaps feel more at home in your body.\n\nAs you gradually feel all of who you are, and the joy in and around you, you might also discover the joy of companionship with someone special. Often, people who are new to sex are worried about how they will do, as if sex were a test or performance to be graded. There is a simple remedy for such feelings. Rather than focusing on yourself and if you’re doing things right, you can focus on what your partner finds enjoyable as your partner finds ways to please you. As you treasure each other, your intimacy may deepen and grow.\n\nThank you very much for asking this delicate question. I hope my answers are helpful, and I wish you a blossoming of your full self."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Partner Is an Addict. Should I Leave?",
    "Question": "First of all, my partner does not hit, abuse, or commit any acts of violence toward me. It’s the main reason I haven’t left yet. I’m writing because I’m curious whether addiction alone is a valid justification for leaving.\n\nI’ve heard of the “three A’s” (abuse, addiction, and affairs) that are warning signs and signals a relationship is in trouble. And I know everyone probably thinks their case is special, or that their lover is different than anyone else who abuses, cheats, or develops an addiction. I am aware the cards are stacked against me. So how does an optimistic person weigh all of those “givens” and make a choice about the future of a relationship?\n\nI have so much hope that my boyfriend will realize one day soon the strain his alcoholism puts on his health, our finances, and the plans we make. I catch glimpses of this realization occasionally when he sobers up (briefly). He has agreed to get help once or twice, but it never lasts. We’ve known each other for over a decade, and I loved the person I met all those years ago! I’m exhausted and sick of being the one person to try to remind him who he was.\n\nAm I foolish for holding out hope that he will one day be that person again? Is there a chance I could get him the help he needs?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing, and I’m sorry you’re in such a difficult situation.\n\nThe short answer to your first question (is addiction a valid reason for leaving?) is yes, with this caveat: it’s not so much the “addiction,” per se, but your boyfriend’s “straining” behavior (as you put it) while under the influence.\n\nYour excellent question also signals one of the reasons living with an addicted partner is difficult: the dual nature of the person’s personality (sober versus not sober). It’s like living with two people, but only you know it. When something this distressing is unacknowledged, a person can start to feel like they’re losing their mind. This lack of acknowledgment of your experience creates a sense of isolation that is itself is a form of abuse, where “crazy” starts to feel normalized or we become numb to it—until it grabs our attention again and we ask ourselves, “Why the hell do I put up with this?”\n\nExcept it’s hard to say “get lost” to the sober version of the person we care about. That version may show remorse, contrition, regret, etc., a stark contrast to the non-sober version’s selfish, mean, and spiteful behavior. Episodes of the latter are often forgotten or downplayed by the sober version, perhaps accompanied by an apology that rings rather hollow.\n\nYou have an extremely difficult decision to make, and for that you may need support. You can look for Al-Anon meetings—highly recommended—near you by doing an internet search. There are also online support groups, books on living with an addicted partner, and so on. There are also highly trained and skilled counselors and therapists who specialize in addiction and living with an addicted partner. I urge you to get support before you make any big decisions.\n\nSome prefer meetings to therapy; with others it’s the other way around. I find that a combination of therapy and meetings can be most helpful. In meetings, we find others who can relate to us, to cut down on that soul-wrenching isolation, shame, and other pain.Addiction puts everyone, including the addicted person, in a no-win situation. Just as someone with alcoholism can’t seem to live with or without the bottle, you love your boyfriend but can’t live with or without him. Leaving and staying are difficult. There is no “right thing to do,” necessarily. Even partners who are physically abused (men included) can find it terribly difficult to leave; it is hard to leave someone we love, especially if we have a history of tolerating emotional abuse, relational chaos, or trauma. (We often cannot help being attracted to what is familiar.)\n\nYou would not be shamefully “dumb” to stay, nor shamefully “selfish” to leave. In fact, sometimes it is such a gamble that jars the addicted person back to reality. It is usually action, not just talk, that gets a partner’s attention.\n\nSome might suggest it’s important to have compassion for the addicted person, and I would agree—to a point. Have compassion, yes, but also set boundaries against hurtful behavior you have nothing to do with and cannot influence.\n\nA good therapist can help you do the painful work of taking care of yourself. We can feel guilty or neglectful if we set boundaries and look after ourselves, especially when an addicted person under the influence lashes out at us for “ignoring” them. But as with a child in tantrum, consistent and firm limits are important.\n\nMy usual advice to people in your situation—barring anything life-threatening or physically injurious—is to take very small but manageable baby steps. For instance, telling your partner (while he’s sober), in as neutral a way as possible, what behaviors are hurtful to you, and what you can and cannot tolerate. Start small. Example: “I need to talk to you. Is this a good time?” If not, “When is good? Tonight at dinner?” Then, at the right time: “I don’t mean to criticize, and this is a little hard to say, but please stop lashing out at me late at night. It really hurts.” You might add, if the hint is not obvious enough, “You seem more angry and attacking when you drink.” Again, try to stay with a neutral tone with a focus on your own pain rather than your partner. Other-focused comments such as, “Boy, you’re one angry drunk,” or, “When are you going to stop drinking like a fish?” are unlikely to lead in a positive direction.\n\nOne can argue facts, but not feelings. If a partner is unwilling to listen to feelings, consistently stonewalls, or becomes defensive, then the relationship is in trouble—addictive behavior or no addictive behavior.\n\nIf your partner says, “Well, you hurt me too! Stop being so critical!” you can say, “Okay, I’m willing to hear feedback too. Can we both agree to do some work on this together?” If you are both struggling with this, relationship counseling can greatly help. The point is to work toward peace and productive communication, not the same old cycle over and over again. Some people reading this might say, “Why is it up to me? I’m not the addicted person here.” To which I would say, quoting Al-Anon, “Do you want to be right? Or do you want to feel safer and happier in your relationship?”\n\nIf these conversations go nowhere, and if efforts to get outside help fail, then perhaps leaving becomes the only realistic option. Again, sending a firm message—I cannot tolerate such hurtful behavior—is crucial. Though difficult, making such a decision may do wonders for your self-esteem and sense of empowerment. It may also trigger sadness or grief.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and again reiterate that you are not alone. Please seek support. Admitting a need for help—for you or for a loved one you can’t seem to get through to—is often the bravest thing a person can do."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Think My Husband Is Gay",
    "Question": "You have to help me—I feel like I’m living a terrible nightmare! I am not the type to snoop, but recently I’ve been seeing signs my husband might be gay. There’s what I think is evidence on his phone of random meetups with men, pictures … and even one lengthy text exchange with a man at his company. I didn’t read the whole conversation, but it seems to be a developing relationship. They were flirting and talking about feelings, “seeing where this goes.”\n\nI’m devastated and confused, and unsure where to turn. My husband and I are rarely intimate, which is an issue we were trying to work on, since we’ve talked about starting a family. I still thought we cared about each other deeply. We get along well, laugh a lot, and typically have a policy of honesty with one another. Or I thought we did. We were good friends before getting together, and we always talked and shared everything. I do remember, years ago, him saying he’d had a fantasy about being with another guy, and I believe I responded supportively and nonjudgmentally. It wasn’t like I thought he was going to actually cheat on me, let alone with a man. I just thought it was a fantasy. I have fantasies of my own that I would never act out.\n\nHe doesn’t know I saw his phone, and I don’t know how to confront him about it all. I can’t imagine living with this information and just waiting for him to bring it up himself. Can we work through this?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like there are a couple of issues to tackle here. I hear your concerns about your husband’s sexual orientation, and I also hear some deep pain at the prospect of his cheating or being dishonest with you. Both sound like they are causing you significant distress.\n\nI’d like to start first with the cheating issue. The loss of trust in a relationship can be devastating and hard to come back from. No matter the circumstances, if you fear your husband has been unfaithful, or is even considering being unfaithful, that is a painful feeling to sit with. Staying silent is not likely to bring peace of mind. Waiting for him to bring it up leaves you in a holding pattern that can make you feel powerless. Confronting him, however, brings its own set of fears. I strongly encourage you to find a therapist who can help you navigate through all of this with you as you decide what path to follow.As to your original concern, wondering if your husband is gay, that lends an additional layer of complexity to your situation. If you suspected your husband was having an affair with a woman, would your response be clearer? What if your husband is bisexual? How might that impact your view of your relationship with him and your future?\n\nRegardless, right now you are operating on suspicions, but without bringing your husband into the conversation there’s a huge missing piece. Perhaps he is, in fact, gay. Perhaps he wants to stay married and start a family, and also explore relationships with men. Without talking with him, you won’t know what he is thinking, which leaves you trying to respond to a situation with incomplete information.\n\nYou do have an opportunity to decide for yourself what your limits are and what you need in order to feel able to stay in a relationship with your husband. Talking with a therapist can help you gain clarity about what your needs and boundaries are. As for your final question—can you work through it?—that depends entirely on the two of you and whether your relationship can meet both of your needs. Figuring that out will require open and honest conversations, perhaps with a counselor who has worked with couples facing similar issues."

    "QuestionTitle": "What Can I Do About My Terrible Road Rage?",
    "Question": "I figured it was time to write in with this question since I just got out of my car shaking with anger for the third time this week. I’m not sure whether my luck is worse than most when it comes to near-accidents and inconsiderate drivers on the road, whether I deal with these instances worse than most, or what.\n\nObviously, I think I’m a great driver. But everyone thinks that. To me, it feels like I get cut off in traffic all the time, people honk at me when I’m doing perfectly reasonable things and obeying the law, and I’m usually very considerate when it comes to people merging, etc. But I find myself yelling at other cars and drivers multiple times a day, flipping people off, and having strong emotional reactions to other people’s behaviors on the road. I can’t arrive anywhere without feeling anxious and very angry. I’m willing to admit I dish it out, to some extent, but it still feels like the bulk of the injustice is done to me.\n\nI know you can’t help other people (or me) become better at driving, but can you help me figure out how to get from point A to point B without seething and compromising the health and safety of myself and anyone around me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Oh, so you’re the one who flipped me off yesterday?\n\nI’m kidding. I also would agree with your assessment that, yes, most drivers (myself included) seem to think their driving is just fine and it’s all the other bozos on the road who need to get it together. You’re not the only one muttering, “Hurry up, slowpoke!” … and so on. In that sense you are not alone, especially should you live in (or ever visit) a major metropolitan area such as Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Boston, Seattle, or Washington, D.C., all with notorious commutes.\n\nI could not presume to tell you what, exactly, is at the root of your so-called “road rage,” but I think it’s a good thing you’re addressing it. All of us get irate from time to time, but this sounds like it could be escalating and ought to be curbed somehow, lest you get so distracted you end up in an accident or an altercation with another driver. It also might be affecting your blood pressure, digestive system, and so forth. A surplus of stress always takes its toll.\n\nOne facet of your letter has to do with, to my ears, control or lack thereof. We are of course powerless over other drivers, though it’s easy to forget that when we’re sitting in our cars, in our own little bubble of comfort. It can be jarring, even scary, to sense chaos threatening that bubble, with other drivers following very different rules and protocols, or appearing to not give a damn about anyone else. Sometimes it seems every driver (except us, of course) has the attitude of “Me first, out of my way!” So it goes in the age of the selfie.\n\nCombine this with our typical American individualism, our assumption of a right to “do things my way,” and our ever-expanding demand for speed and you get a prevailing ethos of anxious impatience and jitteriness. As one billboard for a smartphone recently declared, “It really is all about you.”\n\nBut look a little closer and I think you’ll find that anxiety, even existential dread, is a subtly unacknowledged factor behind much of this. It may sound like a stretch, but hear me out.\n\nDriving is a quintessentially American activity, and our sense of community has shrunk so much that, in a way, our freeways and highways are some of our last shared public spaces. But we seem to have lost, in many ways, even this fleeting sense of “shared” space; all of it seems to have morphed, at least in part, into “my space.” Stop by your local Starbucks and what do you see? Everyone doing their own thing with their personalized headphones, laptops, or smartphone screens, tuning out the world. We crave a comforting bubble within which to operate, free from intrusion, the borders of which are under our control. This may be a kind of bulwark against chaos, a way of self-soothing our era’s growing uncertainty, where the rules of engagement (see our current national election) seem as undefined and disorderly as ever.\n\nAt the same time, most people I know feel enormous pressure to perform in a variety of ways: as a student, parent, worker, partner, all or some of the above. Strangely, the need for speed has only ratcheted up the pressure on expectation for faster, more. Some of us have more than one job while juggling big payments and debts. Our economy is now globally competitive. Thus our bubbles of comfort—within our cars, homes, and laptops—may become a way of soothing the terror of not being productive or inventive enough in an ever-more-fierce, demanding, chaotic world.One senses this on the road, where there is anxiety about feeling blocked or treated as insignificant, or aggressively affronted by a stranger; one Buddhist author I admire, Chögyam Trungpa, said speed is equivalent to aggression. I might tweak that a little to say assertion, as a defense against anyone intruding on “my space,” or the equally unsettling prospect of feeling insignificant or intruded upon (“This is my road, not yours”).\n\nThus you might develop compassion for the situation as a whole, including your own anxiety—make space “around it,” as it were, as anxiety is basically fear. I often find the outside world becomes a reflection of our own internal state. (Pema Chödrön writes nicely about this in her books.)\n\nFinally, there seems to be an almost childlike terror in your message, a fear of loss of control, of frightening or sudden intrusion. I don’t think one has to take a strictly Freudian interpretation toward “They cut me off!” as (literal) castration anxiety. Though perhaps there is a symbolic fear on your part along the lines of feeling disempowered, helpless, that takes the concrete form of anxious agitation and anger on the road.\n\nMy therapist’s ears perked up at the phrases “injustice” and “compromising health and safety.” My intuitive mind wants to link these two together and start to speculate on how such a compromise feels imposed upon you, whether you like it or not. I’m sensing a deeper fear or resentment against having to make these hazardous journeys, without proper protection, almost like a child being sent into a school full of bullies, without anyone realizing what hazards you’re actually facing. What, in other words, is the larger or broader emotional context of your life? It can be easier to be angry at faceless drivers than those closest to us, loved ones or family; is it possible these rude drivers (and there are many) are not the only ones you’re resenting? If this is the case, why? What is making you angry or anxious in your other situations—at home, at work, with family, and so on? (Anger is usually the “first line of defense” atop deeper emotions.)\n\nI sense, in other words, a more personal injustice being felt by you, one that is coming out behind the wheel. You might confide in a counselor to release some of whatever angry or hurtful emotions you might possibly be sitting on, maybe communicate them to the right people to help you with whatever feels burdening or imposing. Perhaps a counselor can help you figure out what these emotions are, as sometimes we genuinely don’t know, only that they keep popping up out of nowhere.\n\nMost of all, allow some empathic space for yourself to be human. This is a more common problem than you might think, which is why I’m so glad you wrote in. More often than not we are, for all our hyper-individualization, in the same collective boat, trying to right said boat through choppy waters. Thanks again!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Am I Crazy for Talking to Myself All the Time?",
    "Question": "Apparently, I am the only person in my life who has remained unaware that I have a huge problem with talking to myself and narrating my own actions. A friend told me the other day that I talk to myself incessantly. I asked around, and everyone in my life who spends any significant amount of time around me confirmed it. I’m shocked, since I actually can’t stand it when other people do this around me.\n\nI mean, I’m not totally oblivious—every once in a while I’ll catch myself talking while I’m alone doing some banal task. Putting the dishes away, “Oh, that doesn’t go there.” Or grocery shopping, “Why, oh why, are there 437 different types of ketchup?” Stuff like that. But I seem to do it around people, too. I can’t get out a credit card to pay for something without, “Where is that card? Oh, I left that one on the table. Better use this …” blah, blah, blah.\n\nIt’s incessant, now that I’m aware of it. I don’t want to fill space like that, or make other people uncomfortable, or waste breath saying these things that have absolutely no value. Not to mention people often are fearful or wary of someone who mutters to themselves all the time.\n\nWhy did I start doing this? Does this say something about me or how my brain works?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your question. Although what you describe—unknowingly narrating your world to yourself out loud—is neither uncommon nor an apparent mental health concern, I wonder when it started, what else might have been going on at the time, and why the behavior troubles you so much (that it may trouble anyone else is a separate issue).\n\nSometimes when we’re under a lot of stress, this sort of thing happens. Maybe you’re trying to figure something out, as people do when they’re faced with a difficult problem. Maybe you’re concentrating so hard that the words escape, a sort of unconscious blowing off of steam. Or maybe you’re just looking for an intelligent conversation!\n\nThen again, saying something out loud can be a way to help yourself process your experience or remember something, like reciting a shopping list or a speech you’re going to have to make. Maybe you just like externalizing your thoughts into background music. Maybe this is your way of enduring the boredom of banal tasks. Maybe all of the above.Also, why are there 437 different kinds of ketchup? I’d like to know too.\n\nIt’s possible your inner voice is trying to make itself heard, to help you get to know yourself deeply, but so far it hasn’t figured out how to make contact; it mostly just makes noise instead. Perhaps you could find a creative activity of some kind that allows you to just let your voice rip. Or just let it rip any old time, so long as you feel safe and you’re considerate of others around you. (It’s true that some people are disturbed when they hear a conversation with only one participant, which doesn’t mean the behavior itself should be interpreted as disturbing. Who hasn’t muttered to themselves?)\n\nI want to be clear about one thing: Talking to yourself does not mean you are going “crazy,” if that’s what you’re afraid of. It just means you’re talking to yourself. A LOT of people do it. A lot of people even find comfort in it. The relationship you have with yourself is the most important one you’ll ever have, after all—and how you talk to yourself can nurture or even potentially hurt that relationship, so I encourage you to try not to criticize yourself about this.\n\nA bit more advice: Listen to yourself. Pay attention to what you’re saying, and even more importantly what you’re feeling, when you’re talking. And find someone sympathetic and knowledgeable to talk to—someone besides you, of course, such as a trained therapist—about the unsettling feelings that surround your experience. Understanding those feelings and where they’re coming from may inspire more compassion for yourself and the behavior you describe."

    "QuestionTitle": "Do I Need to Be More Social?",
    "Question": "I’m reaching out partly at the insistence of a few friends, who all seem to be worried about me and my antisocial habits. I guess the problem, as they see it, is I don’t go out and party like a “normal” person. You’d definitely call me an introvert. I’m friendly enough sometimes, but I’m also the roommate who slinks back to my room instead of engaging in prolonged interaction with my housemates. I prefer writing to board games, and Netflix to house parties. I spend a ton of time online and mostly interact with online friends. I do have a few close friends I’ve kept (or who’ve kept me) after college and various jobs I’ve had, and I enjoy their company. We occasionally do activities together like hiking or movie nights, but I can’t really handle large groups or loud noise. And those events only happen a couple times a month … or I only join in that often.\n\nSo the rest of the time, I get told I should have more of a life, should go out more, should be more social. The problem is, I’m a bit worried too. I don’t want to force myself to make small talk with people, but it seems like that’s how you’re supposed to get ahead in life, in a career, or in both. I worry that I lucked out with the friends I do have, and won’t be able to make more.\n\nI’m not unhappy as it is, but I’m tired of feeling guilty for declining social events and doing things that feel better to me. Are humans supposed to be more social? How much does my mental health depend on social interaction and events? And do I need therapy for social anxiety?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing. Thank goodness, also, for the introverts of the world; can you imagine a world full of nothing but extroverts? Sounds like a reality TV show on steroids.\n\nYour letter is interesting in that it seems as though others in your life find your social preferences problematic, while you for the most part sound okay with them. Who are these others who “insist” you reach out? And why are they insisting you come out and play? Do their “protests” seem one-sided/out of self-interest? Or is there a part of you that wants to be more socially engaged but is hesitant? It is hard to tell if they are being empathically supportive or a pain in the … well, neck.\n\nI take it you are not long out of college, as it is mostly twenty-somethings who place such an emphasis on partying, as these friends seem to. Not having sufficient “party habits” is not something to worry about. In a way, the “party” is about dealing with the anxiety of transitioning into the big, bad world of adulthood; sooner or later, the party is over. I work with people for whom the party never ends, and they end up struggling to get clean and sober as a result. Perhaps your choices will look prescient and mature in a few short years.\n\nAt the same time, it sounds as if this is has stirred some internal conflict, or you wouldn’t have written. I would also add that you do sound socially active to a degree and not “shut in.” The ability to maintain close friendships is an admirable skill.\n\nDo your social preferences affect your work presently? It strikes me that you are able to socially engage, meaning you could do so if a profession required it, but you prefer not to as it is as not as enjoyable—or, perhaps, safe?\n\nI must confess, however, I detect a strain of … something … in your letter—sadness, perhaps, or confusion, or some/none of the above. I can’t tell if it’s due to others’ apparent view of your choices or something else, such as a strain of isolation.\n\nWhich leads me to this question: Is there something emotionally undesirable or unsafe or un-fun about joining others live and in person, as opposed to online? I say this as you mention “a ton” of online activity.\n\nSome might genuinely not know how to answer that. Here’s a constructive way to process not-so-comfortable feelings, which many of us would rather avoid. You can try this alone, with a supportive friend, or even with a counselor: Next time you get told to “get out more and join the party,” pay attention to what you’re feeling inside. Do you feel guilt? Shame? Anger? Anxiety? Some/none of the above? It may help to identify body sensations—if they are tense or knotty, and so on. Try to identify these feelings as best you can. Next, try to recall earlier times you felt such emotions and within what context they arose. Did this happen in college? High school? Earlier?\n\nAnother question I would ask: Were you ever asked to join in group or family events, in the past, toward which you were not particularly enthused, even dreading? Were you made to feel guilty or bad for having these feelings?\n\nAgain, you mention you spend “a ton” of time online. This is not the forum to debate the pros and cons of online socializing, but since you mention it, I wonder what it is that feels more enticing or safe or preferable about online versus in-person activity. As a therapist and Gen Xer, my perspective is biased in that I have come to value face-to-face interaction over online socializing, for the most part. While there are friends whose distance makes this impossible, at the end of the day, online exchanges feel somewhat empty to me, not as enriching or colorful as being together in the same space. This is not the case with everyone, however.\n\nOne could write a book about the phenomenon of online socializing (and some already have); my basic theme here is to reflect on what is going on in your own psychological experiencing, and begin to understand your truth, to see where you feel comfortable as things are, and where you might—if you choose—want to explore further or try new things. We all have what psychologists call our “growing edge.” It is not a bad thing to nudge ourselves out of our comfort zones, at least a little, with some regularity.\n\nFinally, assuming “social anxiety” is a diagnosis—and I personally have a lot of ambivalence about such labels and diagnoses, since they often hurt more than help—I would say everyone experiences some degree of it. So try not to get hung up on such labels; if there is anxiety there, it exists on a spectrum and, based on your letter, does not appear to be “severe” or acute. You sound like you’re doing fine on the whole, and the issue is more subtle than extreme.\n\nThere might, however, be some twinge of concern about your experience with other people and what it brings up, and so a discussion with a counselor could help, if only to satiate your curiosity and uncover whatever this possible conflict is about. Though from what I can tell, it sounds as though your fears are more future-based and concerned with “what if” than anything tangible now, besides the possible disapproval of others. But others’ disapproval may be inevitable for those who want to march to the beat of their own drum. Unless that itself is the issue that gnaws at you.\n\nIn the meantime, it sounds like you have a core of reliable friends, and in the long run that’s really all you need. I would be curious to hear more about a possible note of sadness or quiet discontent in your letter, if that is indeed what I’m detecting."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Are My Dreams So Stressful?",
    "Question": "Sleep is supposed to be restful, right? For a few years now, my nights have been anything but. I wake up exhausted because my dreams are more tiring than being awake. They typically involve a chase of some sort, sometimes by car or boat, but usually on foot. It always feels like I’m trying to move in mud, or like there are invisible arms holding me back when I try to run, and I can never get anywhere as fast as I think I can. When I try to shout in a dream, my voice comes out muffled and restrained. Very often, water is a prominent feature in my dreams—enormous pools, open seas, or floods.\n\nThese dreams are becoming more and more violent, too. Though I almost never die in my dreams, the situation occasionally comes close. I find myself encountering and using weapons I’ve never even touched in real life, let alone used against someone. But my dreams present scenarios in which I must fight for my life, sometimes to the death. \n\nI am not a violent person, and the thought of killing someone, even in my dreams, horrifies me. I do feel stressed quite a bit in life, and I imagine that’s a big factor in my dreams. But it’s not like I’m encountering life-or-death scenarios or anything. My life is not filled with violence. I have never been to war. I do not play, and never have played, violent video games. Sometimes I watch scary movies or TV shows, but even those don’t fill me with the kind of terror I experience in my dreams. \n\nI’m growing weary of the trauma of dodging bullets in my dream life. I’ll take any hint or suggestion for how to calm my dream state, whether it’s to eat more leafy green vegetables or stop wearing socks.",
    "TherapistReply": "First of all, thank you for reaching out. I have much compassion for people experiencing nightmares, especially because our brains and bodies physiologically react as if the experience is happening in waking life. Losing sleep also affects memory, everyday responses, and overall health. The good news is nightmares are normal part of human development and are often exaggerated so we may remember them. Dream pioneer Jeremy Taylor writes, “All dreams speak a universal language and come in the service of health and wholeness. There is no such thing as a ‘bad dream’—only dreams that sometimes take a dramatically negative form in order to grab our attention.” In other words, nightmares are a healthy way for us to work through whatever life-changing event or deep internal changes we are going through so we can tend to their messages. Once we face our fears, become engaged with the emotions, and tend to the dream material, we can “transform the energy.”Here are some thoughts on the particular themes in your dreams that might shed some light on what may be going on in your waking life. It is important to note that although humans share a “collective memory,” we are also individuals. To truly engage fully with a dream, one must be mindful of these nuances, including personal associations, experiences, and emotional content.\n\nTake comfort in knowing that when we remember a dream, it means we can do something about it.The “chase” dream is a common one, especially with women who feel particularly vulnerable in waking life. Often the dreamer is being chased by an ominous being (or beings), which could be anything from “the dark figure” with no recognizable features to monstrous entities such as dinosaurs or zombies. It is important to note who or what is doing the chasing, paying close attentions to the characteristics. Who are you killing? What types of weapons are you using? If it is a vampire, are you dealing with lifeless bloodsucking energy in your life? Perhaps there are parts or patterns that need “killing off” in terms of character traits/people/situations/habits in your life that are no longer working for you. These types of dreams are common because there is an actual physiological paralysis that occurs naturally during the REM (rapid eye movement) stage in sleep so the dreamer does not physically act out dreams (and hurt somebody!). Sometimes this state might seep into dreams as the condition of not being able to walk, run, or move, especially when in danger. It could also be a symbol of feeling helpless or stuck in a situation in waking life. The big wave, pool, or flood in a dream is pretty common, and it often indicates either some emotional overwhelm in the dreamer’s waking life or “big material” coming out of the unconscious. Am I feeling overwhelmed? Am I not tending to my emotions? \n\nYou mentioned the nightmares began years ago. I would explore if there was any particular event that happened when the nightmares began. One of the main symptoms of trauma is the affliction of frequent or recurring nightmares.\n\nIn my experience as a therapist specializing in dreams, I have noticed that the more engaged a person is in the healing work, the deeper the healing that can take place. This includes getting support from a professional who is trained in working with nightmares and dream analysis."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Parents Are Awful Racists! What Can I Do?",
    "Question": "I recently attended a family reunion (full disclosure: this was in the deep south) and was horrified to discover how closed-minded and bigoted my parents have become. My family has always been relatively conservative, but this last trip showed their true colors and ignorance. They made blatantly racist remarks, said awful things about LGBT people, and proclaimed their intent to vote against extended rights for minorities.\n\nI was appalled, to say the least, and too shocked to speak articulately on the matter at the time. It’s 2016, and yet I felt I’d entered a time machine and been transported back to 1916!\n\nNow that the event has passed, I’m still troubled by their elitism and hatred, and I’m left wondering if there’s anything I can do. They live in an echo chamber of their own beliefs—meaning I know their community and friends just reflect their “values.” So I’m not very optimistic about being able to open their minds, let alone change their thought patterns and attitudes. Is it possible? Should I try regardless? In some ways I feel like I’m trying to single-handedly cure people who are addicted, so ingrained are their habits and backward ideals. I wish there were interventions for racism.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for reaching out and opening this often-challenging discussion. Family can be both interesting and complicated, and when we add in hot topic discussions they become even more so.\n\nWhile I deeply appreciate your desire to affect change in your family, attempting to change a deeply ingrained belief system is very challenging. As you noted, these particular family members are in an environment where those who share those beliefs surround them. When that is the case, it is extremely difficult for anything other than those beliefs to stand. In fact, there is a theory called “confirmation bias” that shows people tend to look for and interpret information in a way that supports their beliefs; anything coming their way that contradicts that may not matter.\n\nThe only thing we really have power over is ourselves. While we may attempt to impact the world and those around us, we are responsible only for our own actions. Really, no matter how hard you try, you are not responsible for “curing” them or changing their minds, thought patterns, or beliefs. The best you can do is to offer the information to them; what they do with it is in their hands. If you try to take on the burden of changing your family system, you are assuming responsibility for something that is not yours—and that is an unrealistic burden to carry.My suggestion is to offer the information to your family without the expectation that they can integrate it, accept it, or that it will change their beliefs. You can be a beacon of light in your family of acceptance and more progressive values, but also know that openly stating your beliefs may put you at odds with your family. You may face criticism and ridicule for stating your beliefs. Only you can determine if that’s something you’re willing to deal with in order to be a force of change. There is a chance your efforts will yield nothing, but there is a chance that others may be impacted. The trick is being able to go forward without expectations and without feeling as though changing your family is your job.\n\nThere is a saying that being a helper is like being a lighthouse—the lighthouse just stands and shines and doesn’t go chasing boats to save. I suggest you be a lighthouse in your family and shine with justice, kindness, love, and acceptance for all people. As you do so, your very presence may illuminate the dark places. When you hear your family members saying things that are racist, bigoted, or something along those lines, find ways to gently confront it. One way to call it out is when someone makes a racist, sexist, or bigoted joke, say, “I don’t get it. Can you please explain?” That way, they are forced to explicitly explain the “humor” behind the “joke,” revealing the issue. When you adopt this stance, you are not being confrontational while still illuminating the issue.\n\nMost of all, be gentle with them and yourself. These types of thought patterns go way back and can be hard to change. While it is always worthwhile to challenge the status quo, also consider some ways in which you can make a difference for future generations. Maybe you can’t change old ways in your family, but you can work to impact how the newer generation sees the world. I’d like to commend you for your awareness and for your willingness to serve as an ally. We need more allies in this world, and your efforts are noticed and appreciated."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is It Selfish to Bring a Child into an Unstable World?",
    "Question": "I grew up in a large, loving family, and thought for most of my life that I’d have a few kids of my own. I do ache for a family all my own, children to shape, share, and dream with, and the life that comes with being a part of something bigger than myself.\n\nBut in an increasingly hostile and unstable world, I have found myself in recent years questioning whether bringing another soul into it is a selfish or irresponsible act. I am not generally a pessimistic person, but trends over the past couple of decades—violence, overpopulation, pollution, disease proliferation, climate change, and more—give me little reason to believe the world will be a hospitable or positive environment for any children I choose to have (by the time they become adults, anyway). I don’t think I’m being overly fearful. These concerns are real, and they’re not going away. If anything, they’re very likely to worsen.\n\nSo where does that leave me? These concerns aren’t stopping most people from having children. All my friends are having them, blissfully leading their new, bigger lives seemingly without any consideration for what their children will face 10, 20, 50 years from now. I wouldn’t ever call these parents selfish or irresponsible to their faces, but I do think they are, at least to some degree. If I have children of my own, I think I’ll feel like a hypocrite. If I don’t have children, I may feel like I have the moral high ground but my life will be emptier, too. I don’t know how to reconcile these feelings.\n\nAm I looking at this all wrong? Please help!",
    "TherapistReply": "The tension you are describing, between general principles and specific emotions, is challenging to reconcile. You are essentially torn between your head and your heart. Yes, the world can feel like a dark and scary place, particularly when so much of the news we read and hear focuses on tragedy. And yes, overpopulation is a global concern. Your concerns are real, and thinking about the world that your potential child(ren) might inherit is not unreasonable.\n\nI wonder, however, about the role hope has for you as you look to the future. Is it possible that our children and our children’s children might play a pivotal role in reshaping the world for the better? In many ways, hope in the face of bleak prospects is one of the most radical stances we can take, and there is little in this world more hopeful than bringing a new life into this world. The parents you see “blissfully living their lives” are likely incredibly concerned, like you are, about the world their children will inherit. Perhaps that makes them more likely to live intentionally and seek solutions to the issues we face globally.None of us knows what will come next—what changes the world will see, what surprises our futures have in store for us. If we live only with thoughts about the long-term future, we risk missing the joy that can be found in the present moment. Your expressed desire to experience “the life that comes with being a part of something bigger than myself” is powerful and reveals something about how you find meaning in the world. There are, however, many ways to experience that life. If adding to the global population truly does not sit well with you, there are ways to parent and nurture children who are already in the world and who could benefit from having loving adults to share and dream with.\n\nAs you try to reconcile your mixed feelings, it might be helpful to find a good sounding board to explore how you might live authentically without denying yourself opportunities to live meaningfully. Counseling can be a great resource.\n\nOne final thought: I hear your concern about feeling like a hypocrite if you make choices at odds with your stated principles. True wisdom lies in reshaping our beliefs as we learn more about ourselves through life experience. This isn’t hypocrisy, it is growth. As you explore your feelings, it will be important to be open to reexamining what you believe and to be compassionate with yourself as you change and continue developing your worldview."

    "QuestionTitle": "War Changed My Husband; Should I Feel Guilty for Leaving?",
    "Question": "Three months ago, my husband returned from his second deployment to the Middle East. I was excited to see him and resume our life together, but he came back to me a changed man, and not for the better. He barely talks to me. He just sits there and watches television or goes out drinking or lays in bed all day. Every time I try to talk to him, he gets snippy and tells me to leave him alone. I can count the number of times we’ve had sex on one hand. He has made me cry numerous times and he acts like I’m not even in the room, let alone tries to comfort me or apologize.\n\nI have gathered from people I’ve talked to that he witnessed some horrific things while deployed, including bombings, shootings, and several deaths. He has told me he was shot at repeatedly. I don’t mean to downplay the effects that can have on a human being. I can’t imagine having been in that position. I don’t doubt that it would change me, too. I know he’s hurting terribly, and I want to help, but he won’t let me. He won’t let me in.\n\nAfter talking it over with my parents, I’ve decided to leave him, at least for now. I just can’t subject myself to the hurtful language and behavior anymore. He’s not treating me like a wife or even a friend, but rather like the enemy. And yes, for the record, I feel guilty about leaving, but should I? I feel like I’ve done everything I can do. Maybe you have other ideas. I hurt for him, for me, and for our marriage.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing. I read your question with a heavy heart, feeling sadness for your husband and for you. I would not blame yourself or consciously nurture guilt or shame. It sounds as though distancing yourself was a necessary last resort. I do not think your husband is fully conscious of what he is doing, nor do I think you are acting selfishly.\n\nNot to downplay your suffering in the slightest, but your husband has been to hell and back. His feelings and behavior are not inconsistent with other veterans exposed to such horrific trauma. It may be posttraumatic stress (PTSD) or dissociative numbness or some/all of the above, but I do know that too many of our veterans are not receiving the treatment they need and ought to have, considering their selflessness and risk. Not long ago I read that PTSD is not a qualifying condition for receiving the Purple Heart, that only obvious physical injuries qualify. This, I think, indicates the stigma of shame and corresponding ignorance accompanying mental health issues, which only superficially appears to undermine stereotypes of “bravery” and so forth. As always, we tend to be afraid of what we can’t tangibly see or explicitly define, and psychology remains a curious mix of art and science (and philosophy, and literature …).\n\nYet what could be braver than facing one’s own inner “demons”? A veteran I once treated briefly for addiction said he found facing “the monster within” was more frightening than actual gunfights he’d seen on assignment. Your husband is in the awful predicament of needing to process indescribably hellacious experiences, within the right setting with a trained professional, of course. This could never be expected of a partner or loved one.\n\nAcute trauma also, as indicated by your empathic, eloquent question, affects the families of those suffering, as the traumatized one’s behavior pushes others away. You, too, sound traumatized in being neglected, shut out, demeaned, and so forth—painful experiences for someone who, I surmise, longs to reconnect with a long-absent spouse.\n\nIt is interesting that some people, including some professionals, call patterns of psychological suffering “disorders.” But if you put it in context, both you and your husband are having a normal, human reaction to extreme circumstances which would be “disordering” to anyone. Being abused in childhood or traumatized in battle might, for instance, lead to addictive or depressive (or other) issues, though it’s worth asking whether it is the person or their traumatizing experiences that are disordered.\n\nYour husband returned to “normal life” with profound suffering and perhaps shame, and reacts by “acting out” (I mean this non-pejoratively) what he is feeling, keeping you at a painful distance and emotionally wounding you in the process. Perhaps he feels too overwhelmed or ashamed to express his pain and corresponding inadequacy, and so he enacts his trauma on those closest to him as a way of unconsciously expressing what he feels inside but cannot express, hiding his vulnerability defensively, even hurtfully. Clearly, there is some kind of unbearable risk for him in allowing the kind of intimacy you so understandably want and miss.His own repressed or dissociated trauma feelings are, in other words, probably similar to what you are feeling: shame, a sense of feeling torn, abandoned, and abandoning (since he may also long to reconnect but is too terrified or wounded to do so, perhaps guilty or ashamed he left you behind or is doing so now in his withdrawal). In a bizarre way, he may feel he is protecting you from the chaos within; if he feels he is drowning in unexpressed pain and terror, he may not want to pull a beloved into the maelstrom. He may say, in other words, “You couldn’t handle it,” while you respond, “Try me.”\n\nOften trauma makes a person into a kind of wary rescue animal—strong but brutalized, rowling or hissing angrily over and over again at anyone who approaches, until they can, slowly and painstakingly, learn to trust again. It is hard, if not impossible, for us to do this without the proper support.\n\nOf course, what your husband may be missing or repressing is that the distancing itself is hurtful to you and the relationship, and ultimately self-sabotaging, since what he (likely) needs most of all is human connection, emotional safety, and deep validation of his suffering, in a way that confirms (and not undermines) his manhood. (He may unconsciously feel he is “the enemy” for being so “weak” and shamefully afraid, may feel shame or guilt that he could not protect or save those who died—again, a common reaction.)\n\nAt a certain point, however, we have to get in the lifeboat even if our loved one refuses to do so. It is an impossibly painful choice. This leads me to reiterate, again, that there is no “right” decision here for you. You can stay and risk drowning, or find safety yourself while anxious you have “left him behind.”\n\nIf only we could somehow culturally redefine “strength” to mean addressing and healing, rather than avoiding or numbing, our own psychic pain and isolation. If only, in such a masculinized culture like the police or military, emotional sensitivity is not equated with being “wimpy,” etc. It’s actually the “keep a stiff upper lip and carry on” mentality that is dangerous after the battle has ended.\n\nPerhaps, then, you can role model for your husband the kind of strength I’m talking about. I cannot recommend enough the following: support, support, and more support. I strongly suggest you seek out the kind of education and emotional assistance your husband needs. Is there a “wives of veterans” group, in person or online, from which you can find sustenance, both practical and psychological? Can the local or online VA provide helpful info? I would bet what you are experiencing is also not uncommon. It is too early to abandon hope, and helping yourself is helping the relationship since you are 50% of the equation.\n\nYou might also seek out counseling, either individual or group, via a therapist with specific training and experiencing in this area. Trauma resulting from military service or firefights is not quite like any other, given the specifics of military culture, codes of honor and bravery, and so forth. You can look via GoodTherapy.org, if you like. But do find something, because this is agonizing, if not impossible, to handle on one’s own. Ending the pain of your guilt and isolation will make it easier to communicate with your husband, and I would urge you to not make a final decision until after you have found some peer or professional support.\n\nI thank you again for writing. You, too, are doing your country a duty in attempting to help yourself and your husband address the wounds he carries inside."

    "QuestionTitle": "Am I Horrible for Not Crying at My Father’s Funeral?",
    "Question": "I recently attended my father’s funeral, which was a very large gathering with family, friends, and people in the community. He touched many lives and was well-known around town, so hundreds of people showed up to pay respects. Tears were shed, handshakes and hugs were exchanged, and memories were shared. It was an emotional day, to say the least … but I didn’t even come close to crying. In fact, I haven’t cried at all since he passed. I’ve tried, because it seems like the thing to do, and because people have been telling me things like, “You just have to let it out,” or, “You’ll feel so much better afterward.”\n\nIn general I don’t consider myself a very emotional person, though I’ve been known to shed a tear at sad movies. And I cried when my childhood dog died in my 20s. So it makes me feel even worse that I was able to express some emotion at those times and not now, at a clearly more impactful loss. And it’s not like I hated my dad, either. We’d grown apart in recent years, but I have positive memories from my childhood when my dad was around and not away for military service, as he often was.\n\nMy two siblings are grieving in “normal” ways, and they definitely think I’m some kind of monster for not crying at all, especially at the funeral. Meanwhile, I’ve been the one with a clear head on my shoulders to help our mother arrange the memorial, get her finances in order, etc. So at least some good has come out of my apathy. But I do wonder why I’m not reacting more strongly, and whether I should be doing something to make myself move through grief more.\n\nWould it be helpful to try to make myself cry? Does crying need to be a part of grief? I don’t want to draw the grief process out unnecessarily if I can instead just move forward.",
    "TherapistReply": "A parent’s passing can be a momentous time in one’s life—and assuming we know and outlive them, we all experience it eventually. Each of us will react in our own way. That means we will cry or not, feel sad or not, feel free or not, feel glad or not. Whatever our feelings or, more accurately, mixture of our feelings, we will be affected—some people more, some less, some more openly expressive, some less. That’s all part of being human.\n\nYou dubbed yourself “Dried Up.” I was surprised when I read that. What does it mean? Then I thought, “dried up” implies that what was wet before is dry now. I wonder if there were times in your early life when you were unhappy, and now you’ve reached equilibrium.\n\nYou write that you cried when your dog died and you also cry at certain movies. Some movies are arranged to make people cry; that’s their purpose. And when your dog died, you were in your 20s, a time when people start truly becoming adults. Although I don’t know you well enough to unravel what made you who you are, it’s certainly possible your dog’s death may have been associated with the end of your childhood. If so, you may have cried both for the dog and also that it marked the ending of a precious time in your life.\n\nNow that your father has died, you wonder why you don’t cry. You wonder if there is something wrong with you, perhaps. That presumes that crying is not only normal, but mandatory.Who says you have to cry? Every person experiences grief in their own way and in their own time. Everybody expresses their emotions differently, and there is no right way to do it. It’s a purely individual matter. You write that you are generally reserved emotionally—that’s neither a positive nor a negative attribute, but rather a description of your place on a continuum of emotional expressiveness. Some people are more openly expressive, some less, just like some folks have brown eyes and others have blue eyes.\n\nYour siblings seem to have precise ideas about the right and wrong ways to have feelings and subsequently show them. I wonder if this is not part of a larger story about how you relate to one another. They are not pleased with you because you did not display grief as they did. Do you all have to be the same? Is there only one way to be?\n\nYou speak of your apathy. I’m not sure I understand what you mean by that, and I wonder if you might mean impassivity rather than apathy, so I looked up apathy in the dictionary. Merriam-Webster differentiates apathy from impassivity: “Impassivity stresses the absence of any external sign of emotion in action or facial expression.” What’s wrong with that?\n\nI definitely do not think you should make yourself cry. You shouldn’t make yourself do anything. Just be yourself and let things take their natural course."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Do I Hate Myself?",
    "Question": "I grew up in a fairly loving, supportive environment, and I don’t understand why I’m so filled with self-loathing. I hate my appearance, my mannerisms, my personality—everything. Most of the time I don’t understand why someone would want to date me or even be my friend.\n\nA bit about me: My parents got divorced when I was young, but it wasn’t the messy, hateful kind I sometimes read about. They both loved me and I remember spending equal time with both of them. We’d go on trips and I remember being happy. I’ve had friends all my life, and though I got teased a bit in school (like I think all kids do at times), I wasn’t tortured by bullies or scared to go to school.\n\nBut around the time I got to high school all of my jokes started being at my own expense, and my friends would get tired of my self-deprecating humor. A couple of people have told me it makes me difficult to be around—but, of course, that just makes me hate myself even more.\n\nI’m nearing my 40s and am single, and would like to find a partner at some point, though I’m not sure I deserve it. Everything I see keeps saying, “You have to love yourself first,” and, “No one will love you unless you love yourself.” Is that true? I want to like myself, but I have no idea where to start. Any suggestions?",
    "TherapistReply": "To some extent, yes, it is true that until you love yourself, you are unlikely to be able to receive love fully from another. It doesn’t mean others won’t love you; it means you might not be able to experience their love, might question their love, and ultimately may push their love away.\n\nIt sounds as if you have been struggling with this for a very long time, and I wonder if you have explored counseling as a way to learn more about where these feelings of self-loathing and dissatisfaction come from and how to combat them. If you haven’t tried counseling yet, I strongly recommend that you do so.From your description, it sounds as if your self-deprecating humor may have started out as a bit of a defense mechanism in high school. It’s not uncommon to use jokes at our own expense to defend ourselves from feelings of insecurity and fears of rejection. A common thought is that if we can name our faults ourselves, nobody else has ammunition to use against us, and the sting of another’s insult will somehow be less painful. What often happens is this defense mechanism becomes a habit. Then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We downplay our self-worth until we cease to believe we have any.\n\nThe good news is habits can be unlearned. Those messages you’ve been giving yourself (and those around you) can change. It begins with exploring the radical notion that we all are worthy of love, even when we don’t feel worthy. It begins with finding the things about ourselves that we do appreciate (even if they are small). Often, when I ask people in therapy to share their strengths, they struggle to identify any. When I rephrase and ask what their loved ones would identify, they are able to list several. Starting to see your gifts and strengths through the eyes of others can be a place to begin as you move toward eventually claiming your own value and self-worth."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Am I Supposed to Stop Being Crazy?",
    "Question": "So I know “crazy” isn’t an acceptable term these days, but it’s a term I genuinely identify with, since I don’t know what’s wrong with me and find myself making decisions and doing things even I would say are crazy. I often experience irrational hatred toward people I barely know, especially if I want something they have or think they’re extremely attractive. I’ll obsessively text an ex after we break up, or I’ll pick a fight with a friend for no apparent reason. And then I have this brain-fog feeling afterward and can’t help wonder if it was really me who did those things. I remember it all and feel guilty and cry … and then keep doing similar things!\n\nI feel like I leave the destruction of a tornado in my path. My friends, though they seem to stick around, have called me crazy, and we joke about how I’m the “hot mess” type. But they keep me at arm’s length, and deep down I know they’re right to do so. Things aren’t adding up in my own head. I don’t want to be manipulative and passive-aggressive, and I don’t want to act so irrationally and keep driving people away. Help?",
    "TherapistReply": "Well, I see you have kept a sense of humor. And you have a circle of loyal friends, too. You understand and agree with how they see you, and how they protect themselves by “keeping you at arm’s length.” All of these are strengths you should be proud of.\n\nNevertheless, you’re puzzled by your behavior, which you say leaves “the destruction of a tornado.” You describe yourself as angry, obsessive, manipulative, passive-aggressive, and hating in some instances. You say your actions “don’t add up” and are irrational. You describe a “brain-fog” feeling that makes you doubt if it was really you “who did these things.” Then you remember it all, “feel guilty, and cry.” You think you are crazy, even though you feel the word “crazy” is unacceptable.\n\nI think you have made a wise and courageous first step by writing in to ask this question. Now it’s time for the next step, to consult with a therapist in person. That can feel a lot scarier than writing, but you will get a more valid opinion from someone you see in person and can talk with. Why not consult a mental health professional and see what that person thinks? Do you have a medical doctor? Perhaps there is a physical problem causing you distress. That can be a good place to start. Without more information from you, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate as to what might be going on beneath the surface.Check your resources. Are you involved with a religious leader who might refer you to someone who can help? Is there a school near where you live that might have a referral service? Who might help? You might see a professional such as a social worker, psychologist, psychotherapist, or psychiatrist.\n\nWhat is it like to see a mental health worker? Typically, you will call for an appointment, meet with the therapist, explain your concern, and answer questions about yourself—the kinds of questions, actually, you are already asking yourself, as I can see from your letter. You can also ask questions of the therapist, such as what might be the problem, how long does it take to work on this, what happens next, have you worked with someone like me in the past, how did that go, and what do you think?\n\nJust as the therapist is getting to know you, remember that you, too, are getting to know the therapist, and your opinion matters. Do you feel comfortable, even though you might feel nervous? Do you find the therapist likable? Do you think you will feel more at ease to speak freely after a getting-to-know-you period?\n\nThank you so much for writing in and asking this question. When people ask questions, they open up the world for themselves and for others."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Husband Wants to Go Back to School, Not Work",
    "Question": "I’m a wife, mother of two, and have a great career in the legal field. I’ve been supporting my husband since we got married three years ago while he finished his degree, which he did nine months ago. The plan was for him to start his own career after he graduated, but he has had no success finding a suitable job and is quickly losing hope for finding work in the field he studied.\n\nHe has a history of depression, and I think he is quite depressed. The only types of jobs he can get right now are for minimum wage doing things like janitorial work. He is unwilling to do that type of work out of concern it will kill his spirits and make it harder for him to get a job he really wants.\n\nInstead of focusing what little energy he has on finding the job he wants, now he’s talking about going BACK to school to study something else with better career prospects. Needless to say, I’m not too keen on this plan, as I didn’t think I was signing up to be the sole breadwinner for the first five to seven years of our marriage, if not longer. It’s starting to feel like he’s taking me for granted and instead should be redoubling his efforts to put the degree he just attained to use.\n\nI think he expects me to go along with his new plan. It’s true that I can afford to provide for the family by myself indefinitely, but that doesn’t sit well with me and it doesn’t feel fair or reasonable. I am afraid to bring up my true feelings about this out of fear it will worsen his depression and sense of hopelessness. His mental health seems precarious as it is.\n\nHe’s a good father despite not being my children’s biological dad. He’s a good husband, too, aside from this ongoing saga. I just don’t know what to do. I want to be with him, but I don’t know if I’m willing to go down this road again. I don’t want to resent him, but it feels, in a way, like I have three children. What do you think?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you and your husband BOTH may be depressed, and you appear to be somewhat angry, too, about his inability to find a decent job and help support the family. I feel for you both. It’s hard to carry this load alone, as you have been doing for three years already. I imagine it’s hard for him to be carried by you, too, and to not be able to find suitable work.\n\nI don’t know what kind of career he has in mind for himself, but it is true that some fields are slow starters. Maybe he’s thinking he made the wrong choice for himself professionally and wants to correct this mistake. Maybe you’re thinking you made the wrong romantic choice and want to correct that, too. At the very least, you feel burdened.Despite his real problems work-wise, you state he is a good father to your children, even though they are not biologically his, and he is a good husband to you. These are priceless gifts. His ability to be caring, loving, and nurturing are important contributions to a happy family life.\n\nYou are afraid to talk to your husband about your fears. I understand your concerns, but communication is a top priority in a deep relationship. Learning how to discuss difficult things together is part of learning how to get along with each other. It will serve your relationship well both now and in the future.\n\nI wonder if you have each considered counseling. Your husband might benefit from consulting with a career counselor, and it sounds like you both could benefit from couples counseling and perhaps individual therapy, too. Your family seems strong aside from this issue, certainly worth working to save, in spite of your resentful feelings. Love is a great and important gift. If talking this through with your husband (with or without a counselor present) would help preserve your marriage, consider it an investment in your family.\n\nThis is a decision you must make together. If you both want to stay together, or if you’re deciding on perhaps parting, please act to find counselors or social workers who can help you with this choice. Professional help can allow space and clarity to make any important decisions.\n\nMarriages need to be cared for by both partners, but sometimes outside circumstances don’t favor family life—in fact, it can seem like they conspire against you. I hope you’ll do everything you can, together, to prevail. Silent resentment never works."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Sister Lies, Steals, and Takes Advantage of Our Mom",
    "Question": "My sister has taken advantage of our mother for years. Beginning in her teenage years, she has lied, stolen money, used drugs, left home several times, used physical violence against family members, and run up charges on numerous television and phone accounts. She also drove our mother’s car frequently, with or without permission, and had several traffic accidents, totaling two separate cars, before she could no longer be insured as a driver.\n\nEach time our mother has insisted she move out, she eventually comes back with some new sob story—her friends stole her money, her boyfriend cheated on her, she lost her job, she’s sick—and she is allowed to move back in. Our mother feels sorry for her because she has a lot of health problems, and she also doesn’t want to abandon her child, but my sister is 26! No matter what is given to her or done for her, she continues to lie, steal, and manipulate. Our mother has to sleep with her wallet under her pillow and shift her money between accounts regularly so my sister cannot access it, and she is still in debt from years of taking care of my sister’s many bills.\n\nMy sister is also a constant source of stress to her. She can barely leave home for a weekend without worrying that something will go wrong. For example, last time she tried to take a weekend trip, my sister disappeared for two days after promising to take care of her dogs, so she had to spend hours on the phone trying to find someone to come by and look after them.\n\nHow can I convince my mother to stop enabling my sister’s bad behavior?",
    "TherapistReply": "Unfortunately, you may not be able to convince your mother to stop enabling your sister. It sounds as if your mother is well aware of the issues and challenges your sister presents, and is still willing to support her, even at great inconvenience to herself.\n\nThe questions to consider with her, however, may include: What about this is working for your mom? What needs of hers are getting met by supporting your sister? My hunch is she has some strong beliefs about what being a good mother means—and that may include supporting her kids through good times and bad. She also may be afraid of what might happen to your sister if she did not support her. Whatever her beliefs, they are contributing to her willingness to continue on in this way. Having an opportunity to understand why she is doing this could be helpful for you.The next set of questions is harder, but centers on how well this pattern is serving your sister. There is a school of thought that suggests enabling dysfunctional behavior does more damage than engaging in firm boundary setting or “tough love.” However, there are many exceptions based on specific situations, so there is no clear-cut “right” answer. It might be helpful if you and your mother worked with a therapist who has experience with family circumstances similar to the ones you describe. It could give you and your mom a chance to voice your fears and concerns while working with a trained professional on addressing those concerns in ways that feel right for you and for your mom.\n\nIt also sounds as if you might benefit from an opportunity to let go of some of the feelings you’ve been carrying about your sister, which therapy can also help with. I hear the concern you have for your mom; I also hear the frustration you have with your sister for her behavior. It is also not unusual for siblings to feel resentment when another sibling “gets away” with certain behaviors. It can feel unfair, at the very least. Harboring negative feelings such as resentment, however, can be toxic and keep us in a state of anger and frustration that ultimately don’t serve us.\n\nFor your sake, even if your mother isn’t willing to engage in therapy with you, I suggest exploring it for yourself. You might find ways to engage with your sister and your mother that bring you peace."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Stop My Son from Picking the Military Over College?",
    "Question": "Our son, who turned 18 last month, is about to graduate from high school. He’s a great kid, an Eagle Scout, and a straight-A student (3.96 grade-point average). He’s the president of his senior class and has multiple full-ride scholarship offers from elite schools across the country, including Stanford and Princeton.\n\nSo why, pray tell, would he possibly want to join the military? This is the dilemma our family faces. Bernie Sanders isn’t president. College isn’t cheap. A quality college education is unaffordable for many families, including ours. By the time our son would complete his service, it seems doubtful at best that opportunities like this will still be waiting for him, and we won’t be in position to help him much. We feel like he is leaving not only free money (and a lot of it) on the table, but also his future, and for what?\n\nHis mother and I both see the nobility in wanting to serve our country and we admire him for it, but this decision puts not only his financial future at risk but also, potentially, his life. It’s an unstable world we live in, and not too many people who enlist these days manage to avoid deployment. We’ve tried to talk some sense into our son, but he says he’s made up his mind. Easy to say for someone who has never had to pay for anything in his life.\n\nPlease help us. How can we convince our son that going to college is a much better choice than going to war?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for writing. I can’t help but think the answer to your question lies in the emotional undertone of the question itself.\n\nAs I’m sure you already know, the teen years are often a roller-coaster for teens and parents alike. It’s a phase marked by intense contradiction, as a burgeoning young adult seeks individuation and freedom while under the care and protection of the very people they are trying to separate from. It’s easy to get lost in the minutiae of curfews, driving privileges, allowances, homework, drugs, sex, and so on.\n\nThough I find it a worthy question to ask, what is really at the heart of this? Usually it’s anxiety or fear. On the parents’ side, there is the fear the child will be somehow unsafe, now or later, and is throwing away a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Parents fear that the kid who struggles in school may not be well enough prepared for college later; the kid who experiments with pot may be “setting themselves up for failure” down the road; and the son who says no to full-ride scholarships at elite schools has somehow gone off-track. What the heck is he thinking? That does it, I’m putting my foot down!\n\nThe teen, meanwhile, worries about the same thing, only from a different angle. Can I survive and flourish—socially, financially—once I’ve left the nest? If I’m too reliant on mom or dad now, what happens later when I’m working or at college? I can’t rely on them forever. I know they want me to take these scholarships, get an education, but I want a different kind of education. What’s wrong with that? To hell with ’em! I’m on my own!\n\nAnxiety, in other words, rules the day, as each side feels disrespected or abandoned or shut out by the other.\n\nYour letter is full of understandable parental anxiety focused mostly, it seems to me, on the future. He is “potentially” risking his life or possibly throwing away opportunities that may or may not be “waiting for him” later on. One could say these scholarships are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. You could also say any kid with the smarts to get into these schools with a 3.96 GPA, and with a willingness to take the road less traveled, will likely continue to find opportunities. I know plenty of struggling adults who went to Ivy League schools, and successful people who went to community college, then specialized in grad school or elsewhere later on.\n\nYou have, again understandably for a parent, developed a vision for the best path forward for your son. What father wouldn’t want his son to go to Princeton or Stanford? I empathize with your confusion and frustration. I imagine you’re tearing your hair out.\n\nBut this is the great challenge of this mind-warping transition phase. As a parent myself, I foresee a time when my daughter will announce to us she has decided to become a doctor or lawyer (or better yet, a psychologist!)—which means, of course, that when she’s 18 she’ll announce to us she’s skipping college to join a punk band or travel to Antarctica to save seals. We want our kids to be safe; they want us to back off so they can test limits, take a bite out of the world, and dance near the edge. This is itself the delicate, anxious dance between teens and parents at this complicated phase.\n\nAs I often do in this column, I’ll throw out my 2 cents regarding some practical suggestions, followed by a more psychological angle.\n\nFirst, talk to your son—as neutrally as possible—about what you’re seeing as the risks involved. The idea here is to model balanced decision making. Make sure he knows your “agenda” is only to talk through the decision with him. Does he know what a rare opportunity these scholarships actually are, how few kids get into these schools, for a free ride, no less? That these schools provide first-rate opportunities for networking and lifelong connection for just about any field of interest? That he could always enlist after getting his undergrad degree, or try college first and then decide? You could also talk about what assistance you can and possibly can’t provide both now and later.\n\nWhich branch of the military is he most interested in? What about it, specifically, draws him? What are they offering in terms of higher education down the road? What about any interest in specialty training? Also, to your points about his safety, is he interested in being deployed on dangerous assignments or tours of duty? If the answer is yes, would he be interested in doing some more research, such as talking to veterans who have served where he’s interested in going?I don’t know your son, so he may or may not be taking some of his cues from you. If he is, try as best you can to be an example of curiosity over judgment, and most of all empathy for what he hopes to gain from the military.\n\nEmpathy is the key, saith the psychotherapist. By this, I mean I would try to get as curious as you can about what draws him. Does he like the idea of discipline, training, and order? Is it weaponry and combat he’s interested in? Is it the idea of the safety of a “strong” institution to which he will belong, a new kind of family?\n\nListen for the hopes and yearnings more than the literal aspects. Then you might—as calmly as you can—explain why this is difficult for you (and possibly your wife). You have your own hopes and wishes for him as a caring dad.\n\nTry to avoid a trap a lot of us fall into, which is playing the “this isn’t normal” card. Example: “It’s not normal for a kid as smart as you to enlist and blow off Stanford; it’s just not rational.” The implication there is he’s weird, an oddball, or worse. It will probably make him dig his heels in even deeper. Make your statements personal, not about “what kids your age normally do” or in the vein of “what’s really best for a guy like you, though clearly you don’t see it, is …” It’s possible he does see it and wants to do something else. Better to say, “Well, here’s what I foresee for you, and why, and I guess I just don’t get it, so help me get it.” Or, “As your dad, it makes me uneasy to think of you in harm’s way. We think that’s rare or never happens, but it does. I’m not saying don’t do it, but I am saying be clear about the risks.” You could also ask the gutsy question of, is his seeking out enlistment a way of compensating for something he felt he never got at home or school? You might also be listening for how he thinks this experiencing will point him toward whatever definition of manhood he has developed.\n\nBut again, be respectful, as this is his dream, his decision. You can disagree with it, but I would honor the fact the son you love finds it important.\n\nParenting can be extremely difficult, and it’s a never-ending duty. But sometimes kids somehow have to do the one thing they know drives us batty. It can be a test to see if they will still be loved by us in spite of their decisions, or that they are capable of making their own decisions completely free from parental influence. If there is any element of rebellion in his decision, try to be understanding rather than dead-set against it, as that puts you in opposition and back in the tug-of-war.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and encourage you to post any follow-ups to let us know what happens."

I feel like I am going through life looking at everything with extreme skepticism, mistrust, and suspicion. I have no close friends, and I don't trust anybody except my parents. Here are some thoughts that have occurred to me, just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from: My coworkers are all looking for ways to get me fired. My boss hates me and is just waiting for me to mess up. My doctor only prescribes me things because he's getting a cut from pharmaceutical companies. My financial adviser is only interested in him making money, not me making money. Every waiter I see could be the one who skims my credit card. Every car mechanic is crooked. My girlfriend is going to leave me for someone better looking. As for you, you're only answering this (if you even answer) because you want me to come see you and pay you. Am I right? If not, please tell me why I think this way. I don't feel like I'm crazy, but I don't like living like this, either.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you very much for writing to me specifically, even though you don’t trust me. I think it takes great courage to reach out and describe one’s uncomfortable life situation to someone who is a stranger. You may be skeptical, but you have come forward and made contact. That means something. I hope you go one step further.\n\nGiven that I did respond, you seem to conclude I just want you to come see me and pay me—that I’m in it for the money. It’s true I need to make money and pay the bills, just as everyone does, but the unvarnished truth is I’m answering your letter because it’s my job. What you do next is entirely up to you.\n\nWithout spending time with you and getting to the root of your feelings, I can’t offer a guess as to why you think the way you do, but I can readily see you’re unhappy with your life and worried that just about everyone you know is out to get you, in one way or another. You say the only people you can trust are your parents, and that you have no friends. You have a girlfriend, but you’re afraid she will leave you for someone else. It makes sense that you’d be unhappy.You describe that you are living in constant fear that someone will take advantage of you and cause you harm. You don’t have to live this way. These thoughts, accurate or not, are harmful in and of themselves because the stresses and discomfort they cause affect you both physically and emotionally. You may know that stress can cause a multitude of physical and emotional reactions that may be detrimental to your health.\n\nIt always helps to discuss and bounce around your ideas with another person. Psychotherapy might be very useful to you. You’ve written a clear account of an aching life ruled by skepticism, mistrust, and suspicion. You name your feelings and define your life situation with great clarity. Clear self-expression goes with clear thinking. You might find a therapist who includes journal work as part of a treatment plan. Or you might prefer talk therapy. Sometimes you have to try a few different things, or even therapists, to find the right fit. But if you believe nothing else, please believe help is out there. Perhaps the hardest part for you will be trusting in that, and making the initial call.\n\nWhile you and a therapist identify ways to alleviate your painful feelings, the therapist can help evaluate their accuracy. Especially if you don’t have many people you’re close to, or that you trust, a fresh and objective perspective from someone who knows what to look for can be useful. Fear responses and trust issues are often based on things that happened in the past, and uncovering what those things might be is an important part of finding healing solutions in the present.\n\nThe kind of therapy or treatment you seek and find helpful may depend to some extent on your tastes, but I strongly advise you to make the effort. With some work, guidance, and reflection, you may find that your life (and perhaps your blood pressure) is better for it."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Feel Like My Therapist Judges Me",
    "Question": "I've been in therapy for about a month to help me deal with obsessive thoughts and behaviors. My therapist has given me some resources and some very helpful ideas for changing these patterns, but at the same time, I feel like he judges me constantly. For example, when I told him something kind of embarrassing and personal, he winced, pursed his lips, and let out what felt to me like a judgmental sigh and a prolonged \"Hmmmmmm.\" This wasn't the only time. He seems to be really good at his job and knows how to deal with issues like mine, but it's hard for me to get past the subtle mannerisms, sounds, and comments that make me feel scrutinized and, well, stupid. It makes me not want to tell him things that are bothering me, and I thought the whole point of therapy was to be able to feel safe talking about the things that are bothering you. I am torn as to whether to try a different therapist (and start over ... ugh!), leave therapy altogether, or stick it out and hope it gets better. Any advice for me?",
    "TherapistReply": "You are right; therapy is supposed to be a safe place where you can share your thoughts, experiences, and feelings without feeling judged, criticized, or condemned by your therapist. Keeping a nonjudgmental environment is one of the most critical things a therapist can do. Carl Rogers encouraged therapists to approach people with what he called unconditional positive regard, which is essentially the attitude of “no matter what you share, I still regard you highly.” That is truly a healing condition.\n\nThere are many sides to this to be considered. The first is whether the therapist is actually judging you or whether you are misreading his expressions. While I’m certainly not trying to put the blame on you, it is important to consider that there may be something as simple as a miscommunication going on.\n\nOne of the critical aspects of the therapeutic relationship is openness. It is vital for both parties—therapist and person in therapy—to be able to communicate their feelings and experience to the other. In doing so, you deepen the relationship and trust builds, which helps you feel safer.With that said, I encourage you to share your concerns with your therapist. It could be that he is unaware of his expressions and how they come across. Your sharing your experience with him can help him become more aware and give him an opportunity to change his behavior. It could also be that he does have some judgments and concerns about what you are sharing that he may be able to express to you. In that case, the two of you can have an ongoing dialogue and perhaps resolve the issue in your therapy.\n\nBased solely on what you have written, there is also a possibility that the therapist is actually responding neutrally and you are reading into his nonverbal responses; in therapy, we call this “projection.” Projection is when a person projects his or her feelings about themselves or a situation onto another person and views the other person as holding those feelings. In this case, for example, it could be that you feel judgment toward yourself and, as such, are seeing it in the therapist.\n\nHaving this dialogue can help you to resolve your internal conflict and make an informed decision going forward. By discussing your concerns with your therapist, you can choose your next step in a way that empowers you and not from a reactive space. That alone can provide a great healing experience.\n\nStarting over with another therapist is always an option, but I recommend that as a last step instead of a first. Try starting by talking to your therapist and giving it some time to see how things change (or don’t change). If you don’t feel better about the relationship after a while, that might be the time to find another therapist to work with. The most important thing is that you are getting what you need from the therapeutic relationship, and only you can be the judge of that."

    "QuestionTitle": "We’re Living a Lie: I’m ‘Out’ as Gay, but My Partner Isn’t",
    "Question": "I am a proud gay man in my mid-40s. I've been \"out\" to everyone I know for 22 years, and I feel free as a bird. The problem is that the man I hope to marry, who is my age, is out to no one, and has no intentions of coming out anytime soon. He works in a field where his sexual orientation could potentially hurt him (which angers me to no end, but that's an issue for another day), so I get his reasoning there, but I struggle with the fact he won't come out to even trusted friends and family (his or mine). This is 2016, not 1986! I guess I'm just frustrated and feeling helpless. As you can imagine, this \"I'm out/I'm not\" dynamic has consequences that reverberate throughout our relationship. He won't even meet my gay friends for fear of word getting out and potentially damaging him. I often have to pretend to be straight for his benefit, too. I've even had to swallow my pride and concoct stories about dating women. It sucks to be living a lie in my relationship despite living my truth outside of it. I deeply love this man, and I want nothing more than to be able to propose to him in front of the people we love, and to have the kind of wedding ceremony we both deserve, surrounded by the supportive people I KNOW they would be. Is it fair of him to ask this of me? Should I just accept that the nature of his work will always keep us in the shadows?",
    "TherapistReply": "I hear your frustration coming through loud and clear and it is totally understandable. You’ve been out to everyone for over two decades and feel deeply liberated by it. You know you’d like to celebrate your love and commitment to your partner publicly, but instead you feel pressured to speak about nonexistent women you are dating. The contrast between how you and he are living your lives could not be more stark. Since you are also sharing your lives, there is bound to be discomfort for each of you as you try to bring the other over into your way of being.\n\nThis is a deeply complicated issue and one that is threatening not just to your relationship but also to each of your identities. You identify as a proud and out gay man, and this relationship is pushing you back into the “closet” to a degree.Although American society has made progress over the past 30 years with regard to LGBT rights and acceptance—legally marrying your partner, for instance, was impossible until relatively recently—there is no question that discrimination and stigma are still problematic for many. Perhaps a large part of your partner’s identity is connected to his work, and if coming out costs him his work, he may feel like he is losing a large part of himself. This may be creating a power struggle in your relationship as you each try to hold on to your identities. Even if that’s not the case, it is clear this situation creates discomfort for you in your relationship.\n\nConsidering the depth of these issues, partnering with a couples therapist could be invaluable for the two of you. Through couples work, you could each explore these identity issues and how they impact your relationship. Engaging in the process together might offer an opportunity for each of you to develop a stronger sense of empathy for the other’s position.\n\nIf your partner is unwilling to go to therapy with you, you can engage in your own therapy to explore some of these issues and have the support of a therapeutic relationship as you try to figure out what you would like to do to feel more at peace."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is It Normal to Have Intrusive, Disturbing Thoughts?",
    "Question": "I have disturbing thoughts sometimes—thoughts I don't want to have and that aren't based in reality—and I'm worried about what that means for me. For example, although I would never, ever do this in real life, the thought has flashed through my head of me throwing my dog out of the moving car, stabbing my cat, or punching a friend square in the face for no reason whatsoever. Or swerving off the road intentionally. Or having sex with my sister. Or jumping off a bridge. Or pooping in the neighbors' yard. Seemingly random but disturbing things like that. Not all the time or anything. Rarely, in fact. I know these things sound crazy and awful, and I feel terrible when I think them, but they just pop into my brain sometimes without my permission and I can't help it. Is it normal to think dark thoughts like this? Does it mean something is wrong with me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you very much for reaching out. It takes courage to write and ask questions about experiences you’re not sure are “normal.” You explain that you have disturbing thoughts sometimes, ideas that just pop into your brain and sound crazy and awful, and make you feel terrible for thinking of them. You’re worried these thoughts might be an indication something is wrong, since they appear in your brain without your permission. You sound like you want to understand their meanings.\n\nFirst off, let me just say we all have strange, uninvited, or upsetting thoughts sometimes that seem to arise from nowhere and then simply pass through our minds. Of course, those ideas and images have to come from somewhere, and I would say they come from the unconscious. The unconscious is where dreams, feelings, emotions, and thoughts reside, in the background of our minds, but sometimes they break free of the unconscious and become suddenly conscious and it feels like they occur to us without warning. The unconscious can feel unusual, but remember it’s a source of creativity. We’re all free to imagine anything.We might see something that reminds us of something else, and a strange thought or feeling may arise. I’ll give you an example. The other day when I was in the elevator and the door opened, I saw a person standing in the lobby of my building and had a funny feeling. It was like I had seen this before, almost as though this had happened already—déjà vu, if you will—but the scene actually reminded me of a dream I had the night before. I had forgotten the dream until then, and remembering it made me feel strange. I was in the realm of my imagination for a moment, a bit out-of-reality while I remembered the dream. I was living briefly both in my imagination and in the real world around me. My unconscious mind and my conscious mind were seemingly in cahoots. It felt odd and scary.\n\nAlthough you don’t say this directly, I have the suspicion you might not just feel odd but also guilty about what pops into your mind. Often people feel afraid or guilty about their thoughts because thoughts can feel close to actions. But remember: thinking is not the same as doing.\n\nIt is interesting to try to figure out how the human mind works. The examples you mention include violent actions—hurting others, hurting yourself. It might be helpful to consult with an expert in how the mind works to see what is bringing these types of thoughts to the foreground at this time. Is something happening in your life, something to do with work or love or friendship that is bothering you, perhaps even without your knowing it? Have these feelings been occurring to you for a long while? Weeks? Months? Longer?\n\nWorking with a therapist might help you understand your thoughts better and also feel comforted. You won’t be alone. You seem to feel alone in what you experience, and having someone on your side might alleviate your anxiety and help you get to know yourself better, too."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Can’t I Bond with My Kids After My Husband Died?",
    "Question": "I lost my husband a little over six months ago now. I am only 30. He passed away suddenly from cancer and left me with three kids to raise on my own. I am struggling to want to bond with my kids. I know I should spend time with my kids, and I do make it a point to spend all my free time with my kids. I tend to get overwhelmed by them really quick, however. They are 8, 5, and 4. I know they are still struggling with the loss of their dad, too. I try to take \"me time\" too, but I feel bad when I do. I want to know why I am struggling so much to bond with my children. Am I scared that I am going to lose them too? Am I scared they are going to remind me of their father? Am I angry for being left alone with them? Why am I feeling this way? —Widowed\nDear Widowed,\nI am so sorry for your loss. You are understandably grieving. You’ve lost your partner unexpectedly, and if that weren’t enough to cope with, you are also trying to take care of your grieving children—who are likely trying to make sense of an incomprehensible situation. Of course you are struggling.\n\nYou get overwhelmed because your reserves of emotional energy are depleted. Having enough to give to three children is challenging in the best of circumstances. Finding ways to give under these circumstances requires superhuman strength. Additionally, if you are feeling bad about taking time for yourself, that “me time” people recommend isn’t replenishing you but rather adding guilty feelings to the mix. I’d be surprised if you weren’t struggling.",
    "TherapistReply": "You ask if you are afraid of losing your children or afraid they will bring painful memories of your husband. You also wonder if your anger is a factor. The answers are inside you, but based on what you’ve related, in all likelihood yes—to all of it, and probably more. Your world has changed swiftly and dramatically, and not by any choice of your own. Feeling lost and disconnected and sad and angry are absolutely natural responses to all of this. Grief is complex.\n\nThe stages of grief—denial, bargaining, anger, depression, and acceptance—do not necessarily flow smoothly or quickly. Many people move from one stage to another and back again as memories and feelings are triggered. There is no timeline for moving through your grief and integrating it. Time will help, but so will finding the right kind of support.\n\nIf you haven’t already started working with a therapist in your area, I recommend that you find one for yourself and for your children, either together or separately. Having a safe and supportive place to work through all the feelings that come with such a loss and major life transition can help you heal and find your way back to your children … and yourself."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Was Sexually Abused by My Stepfather. Do I Have PTSD?",
    "Question": "I was sexually abused by my stepfather when I was 7 or 8 years old. I was afraid and never said anything, and he was never punished for it. (My mom left him two years after the abuse ended, and I never told her about it before she died in 2012.) I am approaching 30 now. Although I don't actively think about the abuse, I sometimes wonder if its effects are part of the unconscious fabric of my daily experience. I have a hard time trusting people, especially romantic partners. I get angry for seemingly no reason. I feel depressed at times. I don't want kids, despite liking kids. I have nightmares (but then again, so does everybody). There are other things, but they are too personal to feel comfortable sharing here. I brought this all up to a doctor once, and he told me it might be worth talking to a psychotherapist about the possibility of PTSD. So, basically, my question is this: Does what I describe fit with a PTSD diagnosis? What warning signs should I be alert to? And if I have PTSD, is there anything I can do about it? Thank you for your time.",
    "TherapistReply": "I imagine it took a lot of courage to share this deeply painful experience with a doctor and to write in and share it here, too. It seems like you are ready to begin to address the past trauma and take a look at how it might be impacting your life in the present.\n\nWhile I cannot make a diagnosis with the information you provided here, it does sound possible that you are dealing with posttraumatic stress (PTSD) related to the sexual abuse you experienced as a child. Whether or not you actually meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, there is probably a connection between your past abuse and the problems you are dealing with today. These problems—difficulty trusting, unexplained anger, periods of depression, conflicted feelings about children, and nightmares—are warning signs that an underlying issue needs to be addressed.We are very adaptive beings. We figure out what we need to do to survive a situation. As a child, you probably developed coping mechanisms that allowed you to get through the trauma of sexual abuse and survive. Unfortunately, the coping mechanisms that facilitate survival in a traumatic environment can create problems when they are applied in a healthier environment. For example, you say you have difficulty trusting people; as a child who was sexually abused by your stepfather, learning not to trust people was an adaptive way to prevent abuse at the hand of others. Using mistrust as a way to prevent further abuse probably also allowed you to feel a sense of control over your life. As an adult, however, this mistrust may prevent you making yourself vulnerable to others, which is a key ingredient to happy, healthy relationships.\n\nThe good news: there absolutely is hope for healing from this. I have worked, successfully, with many people over the years who have similar stories. We have worked together to help them heal from the pain of the past traumas and to gain insight into how the traumas impact their lives in the present. This insight creates the opportunity to find new ways of being in the present—ways that don’t create obstacles for living full, healthy lives.\n\nI encourage you to find a therapist near you who can partner with you on this journey. You deserve to live a full and healthy life, too!"

    "QuestionTitle": "My Husband Left Me! Let Him Go or Fight for Our Marriage?",
    "Question": "I came home from work the other day and my husband was gone. His belongings—and the stuff he brought into the relationship—were also gone, including our dog, which originally was his. He left a note saying he was sorry, but he no longer had the energy or interest in working on our marriage and that he was planning to stay with his parents until he could find a more stable living situation. This after four years of marriage. Those four years haven't always been a fairy tale, granted, but our problems seemed relatively minor compared to the problems my other married friends talk about. We argued about once a week (mostly over stupid things), had communication issues, occasionally argued over money, went a month or two without sex at most, but nothing catastrophic. We have talked on the phone once since he left, and he's done. I wanted us to go to counseling a year ago, but he resisted. Now he won't even entertain the idea, and seems committed to dissolving our marriage. I tried to coax reasons out of him, and he says no one else is involved, but that he simply doesn't love me anymore, which seems hard to believe. He says he wants to be friends and to end things amicably. I don't think that's possible now. What do I do? Should I let him go? I don't know if I can do that. If I don't fight for our marriage, I think that will send the message that I don't care, and I care with every fiber of my being. I am so confused, anxious, and angry. I feel helpless and alone right now. Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "I can only imagine the range of emotions you are experiencing after a blindside like this. Based on the information you provided, the way your husband handled the situation absolutely seems unfair to you. Walking out with no prior conversation can indicate either a lack of care and respect for your feelings and your relationship or deeper issues of his own. He may be going through something that compelled him to make a major life change with no clear plan of where he was going next. Either way, trust that when he says he is done, he is done.\n\nHe resisted attempts to go to counseling in the past and has let you know that he has no desire to do so now. Take him at his word. It takes two to fight for a marriage—and if he is not willing to even engage, fighting for your marriage will be an exercise in frustration for you and potentially damage what remains of your relationship. Not fighting doesn’t mean you don’t care about your marriage. By not fighting, however, you may be able to begin your grieving process, and subsequent healing process, sooner.It is natural to go through many stages of grief at the end of a relationship. Denial, bargaining, anger, and sadness are to be expected. Given your particular circumstances, confusion and the desire for reasonable explanations would be natural as well. Unfortunately, it is possible that your husband will not, perhaps even cannot, give you the answers you need to make sense of this bewildering situation.\n\nHis departure and refusal to explain or consider working on things has not only hurt you deeply, but also likely left you feeling powerless. One important part of healing will be reclaiming your power. I recommend that you connect with a local counselor who can provide support and perspective as you grapple with the emotions that naturally will arise for you.\n\nThrough counseling, you can determine how you want to grieve and move forward. You can get support to handle the anger and confusion you are feeling. You can choose how to handle future conversations and interactions with your husband. You can choose whether staying connected to him is in your best interests or not. You can choose whether or not to remain friends.\n\nThank you for reaching out. I hope, with support, you find resolution for the understandable pain you feel that allows you to move forward with a clear mind and heart."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! Long After My Breakup, I Still Need Closure",
    "Question": "My ex has long since moved on from me and has been in a relationship for more than a year. I am actually happy for her, but I can't move on the way she did. I don't feel like I have closure. I don't even know what closure is or how to recognize it if and when it comes. I'm also not sure how to go about getting closure at this point since she stopped talking to me after our breakup after I kept pestering her for answers. I loved (no, love) her more than life itself. I feel like the obvious solution here is to just let go and move on—that's what everyone around me keeps telling me. They make it sound so easy. I am telling you it's not. In fact, it feels impossible. Everything reminds me of her. I can't even watch movies involving relationships without reflecting on ours. I obsess about a relationship I haven't been in for quite some time. Other women have shown interest in me and I've even been intimate with a few, but I still feel emotionally attached to my ex and thus unable to open my heart to others. Without closure, I feel like I'm in some sort of purgatory. Any advice for me?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you are still in a great deal of pain after the loss of this relationship. I hear you when you say moving on is more difficult than it sounds. I also hear you expressing a very common belief that you need to be able to speak to your ex in order to gain a sense of closure, but the good news is … you don’t. In fact, it often seems that continued contact with an ex (especially if the contact revolves around rehashing what went wrong) just leads to more questions, fewer answers, and an emptier feeling.\n\nI suspect the answers about what keeps you hanging on lie within you. I imagine the sense of “purgatory” you reference as being less about seeking answers from someone you can’t access and more about the inability to access answers you already possess. It sounds like you have spent a good bit of time trying to resolve this by talking to her, by talking to your friends and family, and thinking things through on your own. I would suggest trying something different—like partnering with a therapist. Friends and family tend to give well-intentioned advice, and while that can be helpful, it isn’t going to help you access the deeper thoughts and feelings that might be preventing you from healing and moving on.A therapist will listen to you and ask questions and make comments that will allow you to dig deeper. Maybe you will learn that you believed your ex-girlfriend was the one you would spend the rest of your life with and those unmet expectations have left you with insecurities and fears; insecurities about your ability to accurately assess your relationships or fears of being hurt like this again. Maybe you will learn that the relationship was actually quite unhealthy in some ways and that is what has made it so difficult to heal and move on. Maybe it is something else entirely that is holding you back. A therapist can help you unpack and examine with compassionate curiosity whatever it might be.\n\nWith the limited information I have, all I can do is make general speculations, but working with a therapist will give you the opportunity to understand why the end of this relationship has been so painful for you. Identifying whatever that is and healing from it may offer the closure you seek and maybe even lead you to a new, healthier, more rewarding relationship."

    "QuestionTitle": "What Kind of Counseling Should I Seek for My Adult Child?",
    "Question": "What kind of counseling should I seek? Our 22-year-old daughter was arrested New Year's Eve for driving while intoxicated and fleeing the scene of an accident. She'd sideswiped another vehicle and kept driving. Fortunately, no one was hurt or injured, but the thought of what could've have happened to her or others is gut-wrenching. Her irresponsible behavior is not new. It started when she turned 18, broke up with her longtime boyfriend, made new friends, and started experimenting with drugs. Since then, she damaged a rim/tire because of reckless driving, totaled two vehicles (one of which we believe was due to her drinking, but since she didn't call the police and had her car towed by a friend, we'll never know!), engages in risky behavior which exceeds that of others her age (in my opinion), and more recently has started dancing at a strip club. Her father and I are worried sick that the next call we get will be to tell us she's missing or dead. I want to get help for myself to learn how to better deal with her and my own anxiety about it all, but I don't know what to look for in a therapist. There are so many specialties to choose from, and I'm not even sure what her problem is. I've wondered if she's bipolar, has some kind of personality disorder, suffers from multiple addictions, or if she just needs help learning how to cope with feelings of self-worth. GoodTherapy.org seems like a great resource, if I only knew what to look for. I feel completely overwhelmed with my daughter and her problems and the many types of therapists. Please. Point me in the right direction!",
    "TherapistReply": "First, thanks for writing. Second, I’m sorry to hear about your travails; I can only imagine the exhausting and frightening roller-coaster you have been riding. Finally, this may or may not surprise you, but even as a therapist I can relate to your question, “What kind of therapy is best?” I recently read an article by a newly licensed and overwhelmed therapist who said there are something like 200-plus “modalities” for therapists to choose from. It seems every other day someone is inventing a new approach to this, that, and the other. One research study says this approach is solid, the next one says the opposite. No wonder you’re confused!\n\nFortunately, clarity can be found, because ultimately any good therapist—in my experience—is there to answer the question, “What is most helpful or healing for this particular person at this particular time?” Nearly all research studies come to the common conclusion that a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship is central to a helpful treatment. If someone has a viscerally strong response for or against one of my recommendations, my job is not to call this “resistance” but rather to listen, explore, and learn what’s going on.\n\nSo, point one: Is the therapist you’re talking to listening to you, as an individual, not a generic “anxious client” or “parent of an addicted child,” etc.?\n\nIn general, human beings prefer certainty to ambiguity, but offering too much certainty as a therapist is misleading and maybe even unethical. No one has a “lock” on what to do for sure. Now, practical suggestions can be helpful and reassuring. A common “tip” a therapist might offer someone in your situation might be to attend Al-Anon meetings. It certainly couldn’t hurt to try the program. There is much to be gained, even if it ultimately isn’t a good fit. (I’ll return to Al-Anon in a minute.) Other suggestions, such as “Take care of yourself” or “Don’t enable the addicted person” or “Detach with love” are a little more problematic, because although they might sound good, but what do they mean for you and your loved one, in this particular case, with whatever circumstances are happening at that time?\n\nWhat if a person grew up in a family where setting certain types of boundaries, or stating one’s needs or limitations, drew traumatizing emotional fire? Are they being weak for not “speaking up” or “asserting their needs”? Trauma tells us something is still prohibited or dangerous, in the present, since we are wired for self-protection and safety above all. This is where self-help gives way to psychology, to empathic understanding and exploration of a person’s experiences, beliefs, and needs. Some parents may tell me, “Not giving my addicted child money feels like I’m killing them.” It would be easy for me to wave this off and urge them to withhold—“Hey, it’s for their own good”—but, again, that might be overly simplistic.I would certainly recommend that you seek a therapist who has experience working with families and parents of addicted children, someone who can empathize and offer suggestions that make sense for you and your circumstances. A sense of safety and trust is essential. One litmus test is, can you give the therapist feedback on what is or isn’t helpful and how does the therapist handle it? If they become defensive or claim it’s all your “resistance,” I say move on sooner rather than later.\n\nOther factors you’ll want to look for: experience with addiction as it affects families; knowledge of treatment options (including local or community support groups besides or in addition to Al-Anon, and an understanding of Al-Anon, come to think of it!); and a patient but persistent curiosity about your experience. If it seems like a lot to ask, it may be; but to be honest, so what? Addiction is a merciless, complicated issue (some prefer to say “disease,” others don’t); it takes a lot from people and asks a lot from families, so it stands to reason people in therapy will, at least some of the time, need a lot from their therapists. It comes with the territory.\n\nI also suggest you try at least two or three therapists to get a sense of different styles and so forth. This is not uncommon, and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFinally, a word on Al-Anon. Some swear by it, others say “stay away at all costs.” I think any rigid position is potentially harmful. I think trying it is a good idea. (It is also good role modeling for your child, who may not be so keen on attending meetings at first but may ultimately find them essential.) Try a few different meetings; attending one and disliking it is common, but no two meetings are the same and some fit better than others. Some are turned off by the spiritual talk, others aren’t. I suggest you take what you like and leave the rest. At the least, it allows people in your position to share their experience in a communal setting, offer practical ideas on what has worked and what hasn’t, and may possibly provide support for those, like you, who are overwhelmed and beleaguered. Addiction is a hurricane, and everyone in its path suffers.\n\nI think it is terrific that you are seeking support. That shows a humility and inner wisdom that should be nurtured and supported by the right provider. Sometimes, what people need most is a sense of hope. There is no shame in seeking or wanting this. Yes, sugarcoating or fantasy can be dangerous, but so can hard-edged “realism,” since the truth is we just don’t know what will happen from one day to the next. It is a day at a time for all of us, therapists included."

    "QuestionTitle": "When Is It OK to End a One-Sided Friendship?",
    "Question": "A friend of mine recently pared down her \"friends\" list on Facebook. She said she was cutting out people she hasn't physically seen or talked to or chatted with in at least a year, family excluded. I survived the cut, but it got me thinking about supposed friendships in my life (real life, that is) that are not serving me. For example, there is a woman I used to work with who I've been there for on several occasions (picking up her kids, listening to her vent about her marriage, etc.), but who is never there or available for me when I need someone. Every time I have called on her for help, or even just an ear, she has had some reason for not being there. She will call me about something she's stressed about, and as soon as I start talking about something I'm dealing with, she has to go. It's always about her and her needs. I have always been a caretaker and enjoy helping people, but in a few isolated cases I sometimes feel taken advantage of. I guess my question is whether it's appropriate to \"end\" a friendship that feels one-sided, and if so, how to go about doing that. I think I would feel guilty and selfish.",
    "TherapistReply": "You know what they say: “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” I guess in this case, your part is the friend part and she’s the “in need” part. You say she calls on you when she needs help, but she’s never around when you could use a hand. It is wonderful to be able to help people, and some folks seem to be natural-born caregivers, but if you’re feeling taken advantage of, perhaps you should say so, directly, to your friend. Initiate a conversation about the meaning of friendship and helping hands, and see what she has to say. Then you could reply, if you like, and share your feelings. This could be a way to resolve an issue that has been festering for you. It might lead to a deepening of the relationship and real understanding of each other.\n\nOn the other hand, if a dialogue doesn’t develop and you don’t believe your feelings are heard and respected, say that, too. Tell her, if you think it’s appropriate, that unless your relationship becomes more balanced, you are thinking about terminating it. It seems apparent to me that you are not getting what you need from the friendship.You write that just thinking about ending the relationship, one-sided though it seems to be, makes you feel guilty and selfish. That’s an important piece of information. What does that mean about how you think about yourself? Must you always be the caretaker? Do you always have to be ready to help your friend out? Do you feel guilty when you discover that you, too, have needs that should be recognized and met? Why would that be? Do your needs feel less important? Do you feel less important or deserving of consideration and understanding? A good relationship means being able to both give and take, a relationship between equal partners.\n\nFriendship implies balance between two people; it may seesaw sometimes if one person is in a stickier patch than the other, but both partners have to know that they can—must, even—both give and receive. Things can’t always go one way. It’s really important for people to know when they’ve had enough and to take care of themselves. After all, if you can’t take care of yourself, you can’t take care of anybody else, either. Before takeoff, the flight attendant advises you, should an emergency arise, to always put your own oxygen mask on first before helping others in need. There’s a reason for that.\n\nThank you for writing about this important question. Many good-hearted people find themselves with problems like yours, and I hope you arrive at the positive resolution you deserve."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Therapist Suddenly Retired and I Feel Abandoned",
    "Question": "I have had the same therapist for more than six years. She recently left the country, with no warning to her clients, to take a parent to their home country to die. The visit was extended due to circumstances beyond her control, yet I was told twice I could expect an appointment upon her return. When she did return, I was informed she was no longer seeing clients—and then I received a letter a couple of weeks later to inform me that she was retiring from clinical practice. I have appealed to her for one last visit for closure and she has refused. I am having to see another therapist to work through the anger associated with this issue and don't remember ever feeling so hurt and confused. Isn't this abandonment and contrary to ethical practices? Is there any recourse I can take to try to resolve this with her, or is this just totally my problem now?",
    "TherapistReply": "I am so very sorry that this is how the relationship with your therapist has ended. You mention feeling angry, hurt, confused, and even abandoned. Given the scenario you presented, I can certainly understand why you would feel these things.\n\nThere is a phase of therapy called termination that happens as treatment is winding down. Termination serves as an opportunity to reflect on the work that has been done and the progress, growth, and change that has resulted. It is also a time for therapists and people in therapy to say goodbye to one another and process the end of the therapeutic relationship. The absence of this phase of treatment can absolutely leave you feeling a need for closure—especially because it was your therapist’s decision to end treatment so abruptly, not yours.\n\nDespite your request for a final session, it sounds like you are not going to be able to engage in the termination process with your therapist. Letter writing can be a helpful tool when you have a lot of thoughts and feelings about a person and the person is not available to have a conversation. Perhaps you could write a letter to your former therapist telling her how you feel and asking the questions you are left pondering. You could even write a response to your letter in your former therapist’s voice. You could process this kind of letter-writing exercise with your current therapist in order to get the most out of it. It can be a surprisingly powerful exercise. Your new therapist may have some other helpful ideas, of course.As far as your questions about ethics and potential recourse, it’s a little less straightforward than it may seem. According to the American Counseling Association’s Code of Ethics, there is a prohibition against abandonment and neglect: “Counselors do not abandon or neglect clients in counseling. Counselors assist in making appropriate arrangements for the continuation of treatment, when necessary, during interruptions such as vacations, illness, and following termination.” However, there is also a section of the code on impairment that states, “Counselors monitor themselves for signs of impairment from their own physical, mental, or emotional problems and refrain from offering or providing professional services when impaired.” It sounds like your former therapist has just gone through a lot—the death of a parent, returning to her home country, and then retirement. It does seem possible that she might feel too impaired to work.\n\nAt this point, it does not seem like you can count on any assistance from your previous therapist in coming to terms with the end of the relationship, but you do have a new therapist who can partner with you to gain the closure you seek. I hope that process brings you peace."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Can’t Seem to Forgive Myself for How I Treated My Ex",
    "Question": "Ever since my relationship ended last year, I have been ravaged and consumed by guilt. He broke up with me in part because I was unwilling to go to therapy with him. I have long dealt with depression and anxiety that meds have never helped, my issues put a strain on our relationship, and I basically wasn't the partner he needed me to be. I had very little energy toward the end of our relationship. I resisted everything, didn't want to do anything, didn't do my part around the house, put my needs first, and even lied at times to manipulate situations so they were more comfortable for me. I have since been in therapy and come to understand and even empathize with his decision to break up with me, but at the time, it felt like my world came crashing down. I felt abandoned when I needed him most, and I was angry. I said and did things I am deeply ashamed of, things that aren't consistent with my true character—nothing violent, but I scared him, without really even meaning to. He cut me out of his life completely at that point. I feel like I ruined any positive memories he may have carried with him of our time together. It almost feels like those four years were a complete waste, for both of us, because of how poorly I handled things at the end. I can't fix any of it. I can't make him love, like, or even appreciate the good times we had again. I could have left the relationship on much more dignified terms, but I didn't. I am solely responsible for the fact he's gone from my life forever. I am extremely saddened and guilt-ridden about it. My therapist has been encouraging me to recognize the lessons and to forgive myself—she says forgiving myself is essential—but I just can't seem to do it. All I want to do is go back in time and change things, make things right. I know I can't, but nothing I have the power to do seems sufficient to take this pain away. Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "Your very sad story is touching. You’re worried that you’ve wasted four years of your life and clearly miss the man who was your partner, and you long for the good times you spent together. Nevertheless, your memories of the good are almost buried in your regret. I’m glad you’re seeing a therapist to help yourself grow and develop and learn how to hold onto the good, so you can learn to care for yourself and how to take care of yourself, too, and become a better partner. It’s apparent to me that you have accepted responsibility for your role in the way things ended, and that shows growth.\n\nPart of human development is learning to accept yourself and your actions, your history, and use it as a springboard to move forward in your life. As your therapist says, forgiving yourself is essential. Once you do that, it’s time to shut the door on it. You cannot return to your past.You seem preoccupied with thoughts about how your partner thinks of you now. You’re worried that the bad times will outweigh the good ones, and the good will be forgotten. This may or not be so for him—we don’t really know that—but what we can be sure about is what your feelings are. You can remember the good and the bad that you both experienced, forgive yourself, forgive your partner, and move on. The best testament to the good times you enjoyed in your relationship is the ability to hold onto the good and go forward with your life. The past has a vote, not a veto. It can vote to show you better paths in the future, but it cannot have veto power over the rest of your life.\n\nAfter some time of healing and mourning, I hope you will be ready to move on and use all you have learned to forge a new relationship filled with compassion and love for yourself and the person who becomes your next partner, if and when you choose to pursue another relationship.\n\nClinging to the past and especially to regrets about your behavior may feel unconsciously like a way to cling to the person who was once your partner, but in fact it’s only a memory you’re attached to. The person has gone away, and you deserve something real, solid, and present."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Resent My Mother for Shortchanging Me in Her Will",
    "Question": "I recently found out that my mother's will gives one of my brothers as much as the other three brothers combined. He was the only one who stayed in the small southern town where we grew up. He hasn't worked for most of his life and still doesn't work. He drives her to the doctor and sometimes cuts the grass. However, he complains to me about this all the time, and about her. I tried to talk to my mother about this, but she refuses to accept that this might be wrong. Her father did the same thing to her; even though she was his only daughter, he gave all of his money to a relative of his wife. You would think she would know how it feels to be treated this way. I resent her for this and also do not speak to the brother anymore. The last time I visited them, he verbally attacked me just like our father used to do. This really bothers me. Is what she did wrong or am I wrong? This really bothers me, but I can't seem to cope with it or just forget it. What do you suggest?",
    "TherapistReply": "There is no question that inheritance bequests can create significant tension and strife in families. Often, one or more of the surviving relatives feels slighted and unfairly treated. The only person, however, who has the right to decide how to leave their estate is the person creating the will.\n\nYour mother may have some very clear reasons for allocating her estate the way she has. Of course it doesn’t feel fair to you—but what’s fair isn’t always right, and what’s right isn’t always fair. It may be that your mother feels that her son who stayed close and helps her out (as minimally as it may seem to you) is entitled to more of the estate. It may be that she is concerned about his ability to thrive after she is gone and is trying to make sure he is taken care of. (If this is the case, it may be that she has confidence you’ll be just fine—though I’m sure that would feel like small consolation.) It may be something else completely, but she has her reasons for making the choices she made.The choice you are left with, then, is how to respond. You can allow resentment to poison your relationship with your brother and your mom, or you can let it go. When you tried to talk with your mother, did you focus on how these choices made you feel, or did you come from the perspective of right/wrong and fair/unfair?\n\nIf you focus on how wrong or unfair her choice seems, you may be met with defensiveness and entrenchment. If you start from a place of accepting that it is her right to make these choices, but that you find her choices hurtful, you may be able to come to a better understanding. She might be able to explain her thinking in a way that makes sense to you, and she might be able to hear and respond to your pain—but not if she has to defend the “rightness” of her choices.\n\nHowever you choose to approach this, I strongly recommend that you find a way to make peace with your mother before she dies. That might mean seeking personal counseling for yourself to let go of anger and resentment, or perhaps family counseling with your mother and possibly your brother. You have the opportunity to address these issues while she is here to respond. All too often, resentments are left to fester until it is too late to heal the rifts."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! Every Sound I Hear Makes Me Anxious and Irritable",
    "Question": "I cannot stand hearing just about anything. Whispering, chewing, breathing, sniffling, slurping, humming—all of these make me irritated, anxious, and can send me straight over the edge. My best friend has a baby-talk voice that is pretty much guaranteed to make me angry immediately. There are times when I'm extremely stressed that people talking normally makes me mad. I know logically this kind of stuff should be mildly annoying, but emotionally I can't handle it. I've cried just from listening to my dad eat soup or listening to my mom hum along to the radio as she cleans the kitchen. None of them bother me too much when I'm engaged—I can eat just fine around other people, but as soon as I'm finished, I have to bite my tongue and try to keep calm as my family finishes their meals. Occasionally I have to excuse myself entirely because I'm past my limit. Usually putting headphones on and drowning it all out is my solution, but several of my classes this year do not allow headphones at all since they're lectures and some of my labs don't allow them either. Sitting next to someone in lecture for three hours who is chewing gum is a nightmare scenario that happens regularly. I feel like such a b*tch if I ask them to spit it out, but if I don't I'm so agitated by it that I can't pay attention to what my professor is saying. Sometimes moving seats is an option and I'll take it, but sometimes it's not. I need a new solution. My parents think I'm just fussy and I need to get over it, but it's been going on for years and shutting out everything is no way to function in the adult world. I'm growing up, and I'd like to grow out of this. How do I do it?",
    "TherapistReply": "I find myself filled with compassion for you. It sounds like so many of the common, everyday sounds of life are extraordinarily uncomfortable for you. I imagine it makes engaging with the world around you nearly impossible. It must feel very limiting for you. I hope that you can find this compassion for yourself, too.\n\nWhile I certainly cannot make a diagnosis from your brief note (nor is this my expertise), it sounds like you could be describing a condition called misophonia—a sound sensitivity disorder. It is not currently listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), but it has recently been getting attention in the mainstream media and has therefore gained some exposure. There is a website, www.misophonia.com, that has news and information about the condition plus a support forum where you can connect with others. Whether you are dealing with misophonia or not, I would recommend that you consider partnering with a therapist for support. It certainly sounds like this is causing you considerable stress and anxiety. You mention that the sound of your best friend’s voice immediately angers you and that your parents think you are “fussy” and “need to get over it.” It sounds like your sensitivity to sound is also having a significant impact on your relationships. Working with a therapist will enable you to explore all of the ways you are impacted by this sensitivity to sound, and to develop some strategies for coping with them.\n\nWhatever steps you take to address this, I hope you do seek out help. You mention sometimes feeling like a “b*tch” and wanting to “grow out of this.” These sentiments suggest you feel your sensitivity is a character flaw rather than acknowledging that you might well be dealing with a condition (misophonia). Regardless of the cause, you are struggling. Being kind and compassionate with yourself will get you much further than being punitive."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Tell My Therapist I Have a Crush on Him?",
    "Question": "I've been seeing my therapist weekly for eight months. I really, really like him as a person, he relates well with me and treats me with the utmost respect. He's done a lot to help me with my depression, anxiety, and some grief I experienced after my last relationship ended. I know therapists aren't supposed to talk about themselves, and for the most part he does keep things pretty close to the vest, but every now and then I get a little factoid about him. These little snippets of who he is are adding up over time, and I now feel like I know him beyond his capacity as my therapist. I know, for example, that he's not married (he let that slip), and all signs point to no kids. He has not in any way expressed any interest in me. In fact, he has been entirely professional even when I have expressed things to him that he could easily take as flirtatious. I have been far from overt, mind you—just little harmless things here and there. It's not like me to \"go after\" a guy, let alone aggressively. I am too afraid of rejection. But I am starting to realize I cannot deny the crush I'm developing on my therapist, and I have decided I'm going to tell him about it soon. I am so afraid of how he will react. Will he stop seeing me? Will he refer me to someone else? Will he deflect my interest and push on? Will he be flattered? Will he admit to sharing my feelings and ask me out? (Swoon!) I know it's highly unlikely he feels the way about me I do about him, and I imagine there are rules against having relationships with clients, so I'm not getting my hopes up. I just feel like I need to put it out there that I have a crush on him. What should I expect? Am I nuts for bringing it up?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for reaching out with this honest question. I commend you for having the courage to admit this is happening and to seek counsel for it.\n\nYou may be surprised to know that what you are experiencing with your therapist isn’t uncommon. In fact, what you are likely experiencing is a phenomenon known as “erotic transference,” which is when a person experiences feelings of love or fantasies of a sexual or sensual nature about his or her therapist.\n\nIt is easy to see why you might have developed these feelings. Your therapist may embody many, if not all, of the qualities you may desire in an ideal mate. The therapist is accepting, attentive, kind, and nonjudgmental and, for at least an hour every week, fully engaged with you. One of the problems with this sort of situation is that you are falling for an image you have of the therapist, not for who the therapist actually is. You know very little about him, and you have used your imagination to fill in the rest. You have created a fantasy of sorts of your unmet needs and have imagined that the therapist is that person.\n\nIt is not “nuts” to share this with your therapist—in fact, it can actually become a significant turning point in your relationship with him. In many cases, this deepens the therapeutic work and allows you to process things on a much deeper level. It will take courage and trust for you to share this with your therapist, but taking that kind of risk in therapy is necessary for growth.There are a number of ways in which your therapist might respond. Ideally, he will be able to help you recognize what is going on beneath the “crush” in order to get to the deeper material. Many times, therapists in this situation are able to work with the person in therapy and generate meaningful transformation.\n\nOf course, if he is not comfortable with continuing work with you, he may refer you to another therapist. Unfortunately, there is no way I can offer a definitive answer as to how he might respond.\n\nWhat he ought not do is share that he has similar feelings or act on any feelings. As you mentioned, there are rules in every state that forbid romantic relationships between therapists and the people they help for a certain time period after termination of the therapy (it depends on your state). Regardless of state regulations, the ethics code of the American Counseling Association (2014) specifies that there must be a five-year period between the end of the counseling relationship and the start of a sexual or romantic relationship. It would be highly inappropriate, unprofessional, and, yes, illegal for your therapist to do anything other than work with you through this or refer you to someone else.\n\nI hope you can navigate this with grace and recognize that what you feel can be and often is a part of the therapeutic relationship. In fact, I can’t think of one therapist I know who hasn’t experienced this, so please don’t feel as though you are an anomaly. It’s very normal, but the important thing is how you handle it; be honest, sit with his response, and most of all, treat yourself with the deepest level of care and compassion you can muster."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Would a Man My Age Have a Rapidly Declining Sex Drive?",
    "Question": "I'm a 44-year-old man. I used to love sex. It was a huge part of my life. When I wasn't having it, I was often thinking about it. I considered that normal, not obsessive. About six months ago, though, something changed. It just started to hold less appeal. I didn't seek sex as much, didn't masturbate as much, and didn't like it as much even when I did engage in sexual activity. This has persisted, and I'm starting to wonder if something is wrong with me. I work out and I feel healthy, but the sex drive isn't there. I don't get \"turned on\" easily. I know it's normal for sex drive to decline with age, but I feel like I'm too young still for that to be it. I have dealt with depression and anxiety off and on for years, but it hadn't ever gotten in the way sexually, so I have a hard time pinning it on that, also. I did use porn for years, and a part of me wonders if I used it too much, so that now I can't get into it. I also wonder if trying Viagra a few times messed with my wiring somehow. Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your honest letter. This is not at all unusual, what you’re going through, for men especially. In a way, it means you’re growing up and are now ready for some honest-to-goodness soul searching. (Which may have prompted you to write.)\n\nCarl Jung once said it’s only when a person gets a glimpse of their mortality, often in middle age, that therapy begins. We lose some of our youthful illusions, and time becomes more precious.\n\nIf I could rephrase your question, it would be, “What really matters to me? And what does sex mean to me? It used to be super exciting but it no longer does the trick, and that’s frightening. Now what?” Some men do find this happening in their mid-40s, though there’s a good chance what is happening is at least as psychologically rooted as it is physiological. Maybe you need something more fulfilling for yourself, out of life, and out of relationships.\n\nFirst, the practical. Many men in their mid- to late 40s begin experiencing bodily changes in which the vitality of youth ebbs somewhat; we may need more sleep, experience more aches and pains, dwell a little longer in the depression or anxiety that’s dogged us for years, and so forth. Our devil-may-care resilience loses some of its bounce, and that’s hardly fun for anyone—especially men, many of whom identify strongly with their potency, sexually and otherwise.\n\nYou may be experiencing some shame along with fear if you have a history of feeling “not enough.” Many men who turn to sex for emotional self-sustaining often struggle, sometimes unconsciously, with shame and self-doubt. It’s as if our bodies and genitals are rebelling or walking out on the job, and we’re a little ashamed of what’s become so important for us, what we think we need but shouldn’t (pornography, for example).\n\nSo, first know you are not alone; much of this is normal for creeping middle age. You may want to get a physical (if you haven’t already) to make sure it’s not a medical issue. In fact, that would be the first thing I’d do, just to be safe. You allude to some erectile dysfunction, which, while not unusual for men your age, is something a medical professional may be able to help with.\n\nI once read an interview with a psychologist who treated men for erectile challenges. She said, “Penises tell us a lot about what their owners are feeling.” Perhaps some of your recent life experience is deflating, in more ways than one; as someone who treats addictions, I can tell you that people often become anxious when repetitive behaviors are no longer the exciting or dynamic outlet they used to be. In a way, this is a sign of maturity, but it can bring anxiety with it.What’s most telling for me—and, granted, I don’t have a whole of background to go on—is that you mention sex but not a partner. The focus, in other words, is on the literal, not the emotional or relationship transactions (love, closeness, trust) that accompany sex. I have always found that sex and attachment (and sex as attachment) to others are interconnected.\n\nSex, like any interpersonal transaction, never happens in a vacuum. Even men who “love ’em and leave ’em” typically are operating out of strong feelings and fears regarding intimacy; perhaps they fear or are ashamed they want it too much, so they dodge it via flings or porn and such. It may sound strange, but some of the men I help have fallen in love with prostitutes or strippers in ways that, from a distance, may seem delusional. (I am not suggesting this is your issue, mind you, though there are parallels with looking at porn.) What I realized is that they were ashamed of their desires for sex, and their own vulnerable emotional needs, because of how safe it felt attaching to someone who “got” their desires (with a built-in distance that ensured safety). In other words, they were “acting out” their desires without looking closer or exploring them in greater depth, perhaps in therapy or a support group.\n\nI’m going to go out on a limb and say your main challenge here may lie in a kind of loneliness at a gut or soul level that is elusive or out of your awareness. It’s a catch-22 for some men; desire for closer relatedness is shameful (not “masculine”), so it gets channeled into sexuality, which is fun and safe due to emotional distance (which porn provides), which is unsatisfying in the long run, leading right back to square one: isolation, shame, and maybe even heartbreak.\n\nWe can “decode” our sexuality in a way that helps explain how we connect with others, even friends and family. The man who insists on being on top or on the bottom in bed may take an overly aggressive (or passive) role in all his relationships (or be passive in bed and dominant in the boardroom). The trick of sex is that it’s a pleasurable respite and the height of intimacy.\n\nGraham Greene, one of my favorite novelists, once mentioned in an interview his belief that as men get older, they get more interested in companionship and less in “exciting” sex. The closeness and trust between partners is what’s exciting, not so much the novelty or the literal physical activity. Not that there’s anything at all wrong with the latter. It’s just that we need to be careful not to put all our psychological eggs in one basket; what is “hot” to us starts to shift as we get older and mature, as the emotional side of relationships gain in importance and we start to think about who we might want to have at our side over the longer haul, the end of which—sometimes startlingly—isn’t as far away as it was.\n\nYou may want to talk to other men who are going through this; a therapy support group or individual counseling or even online support can be helpful in opening up options, understanding, and recognizing that you’re having a very human experience that we all, in one way or another, must at some point negotiate."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! Is It Time for Some ‘Tough Love’ with Our Teenage Son?",
    "Question": "We've tried to raise our 15-year-old son the best we can, but we're at a loss right now. We've found baggies of marijuana in his room three times, and he's never denied that he uses pot. He comes home smelling like cigarettes or alcohol (or both) sometimes. His friends are bad influences, too. He's been suspended from school twice, once for getting into fights and once for not showing up to class. He's going somewhere, just not to school, and that worries us. Sometimes he doesn't even come home and we wait for a phone call that never comes. We've tried tough love, but maybe we need to get tougher. He is ruining his life. Please, any suggestions you have might help. What did we do wrong? What can/should we do to get our son back?",
    "TherapistReply": "For me, the key to the answer is in your last two questions. You seem to assume that you did something “wrong,” leading to feelings of guilt, shame, anger (at yourselves or each other and/or your son), and say you want to get your son “back.” I assume you mean the way he was before he took on the appearance of a “rebel” from a bad 1950s movie.\n\nHe is still the kid you love, still good—just struggling with something beneath all of that strange and troubling behavior. I would hesitate to conclude he is definitely “ruining his life” because I would bet, in the larger context of his life, his behavior probably makes some sense. Most teens go through a rebellious phase, whose aim in part is to annoy or even frighten the living hell out of parents. So I wouldn’t take the bait completely. Of course this is very concerning and needs to be investigated, and consequences are crucial (provided they are communicated clearly and enforced consistently), but something tells me “tough love” or drawing a line in the sand may only alienate him. The trick is reaching to connect with the kid behind all this behavior (fighting, smoking) that also keeps his teenage need for individuation and autonomy in mind. Not the easiest relational dance by any means, which is why the teen years can be very difficult indeed, and why a good school counselor or family therapist can help.\n\nSeeing this as a family problem, not his problem or your problem, is key. Drawing in teachers and school counselors is good, as is including the parents of the other “troublemakers” he runs with. Something is attracting him to this crowd; what is it?\n\nAnd again, what was happening before? Was he a good student? Fortunately, this is all happening now more or less under your roof, which tells me this is in part a communication to you—a rebellious, perhaps angry communication at that. As if he’s saying, “I’m making my own rules, got it?” But what might be happening in the family dynamic such that he feels compelled to “say” and do these things? And why isn’t he fearful of consequences? The compulsion to do these things, which includes numbing or distancing from certain thoughts and feelings, means whatever feelings he’s pushing away and expressing via behavior are more powerful than the fear of going off track in school and developing “shady” friends.\n\nWhy might he identify with these friends, incidentally? Try to really put yourself in his shoes and forget black/white, right-and-wrong thinking. The harder you push for “the right side” of the line, the more he’ll likely stand on the other side and dig in. Welcome to the teen years. But keep in mind this may be the only way he knows how to express whatever is happening inside him, probably inexpressible.\n\nOf course your concerns are understandable, given his behavior at school and his alarming drug/alcohol use. Yes, many teens experiment with booze and pot, but in this case 15 is pretty early for him to be using it in such a casual way (as opposed to sneaking a beer or joint with friends at a concert). Again, it’s as if he wants you to know about it, as it’s happening, right under your nose.\n\nIn some cases, children have tried to be “good” for so long that this goodness becomes a burden, often privately felt, leading to a swing in the opposite direction. Or there’s an anxiety or hurt that drugs and booze cover up. Could your son find some rebellious expression in arenas besides pot—such as music, drama, filmmaking, sports, etc.? Something assertively geeky or super cool where he can stand out and feel good about himself? Teens want to be cool and feel cool, in all ways, be it computer programming or punk rock. These other kids he hangs with make him feel cool, though I wonder why he has embraced this particular incarnation. Of course, many of our greatest innovators were rebels; the challenge is finding an outlet that is free from self-destruction and liberates/transcends rather than medicates the difficult emotions of adolescence. (It’s difficult for parents, too!) It’s likely that underneath all this tough-guy stuff is fear and/or anxiety. It sounds like you may be anxious also, which is why you need to be a role model of calm. Anxiety is contagious throughout a family “system.”\n\nIt’s good that he wants to feel cool and have friends; what’s not cool is that his current behavior will lead him nowhere positive in the long run.\n\nHas your son demonstrated an interest in anything previously that might provide for his self-expression? Anything creative rather than destructive? Can you or a counselor or teacher help him find such a direction? Anything that can “hook” his interest can help him find a way back into engagement with school, such as a magnet school for music or technology, for instance. Volunteer work, too. Karate. Photography. Fly fishing. Think outside the box; offer him incentives for trying something new. Maybe his dad or grandpa or someone could even try doing it with him for the first time or two. I’d bet he has an untapped passion.And now, consequences. I imagine you have leverage, since he’s 15 and, I’m presuming, approaching driving age. He’ll want driving lessons, need car insurance, and so on. Here’s where you get to be loving but firm parents and decide what is and isn’t acceptable. Anything less than a “B” average, for example, means no driving. Missing a curfew means no car (and possibly phone) for the next __ days. Drinking and driving means no car keys for the next __ months, minimum, and the loss of other privileges (social media, etc.).\n\nYou and your husband ought to decide, first, what is and isn’t acceptable to you both. Make sure you’re both on the same page. The calmer you are in general, the safer he’ll feel bringing his troubles to you. I recommend tough love if and after the other ideas flop.\n\nUsually a child his age struggles with developmental challenges. He may not be completely comfortable talking to you about them, which isn’t your fault. Is there a school counselor or teacher who can get involved? What do these folks, probably seasoned observers of teens, think might be happening? What about the parents of his pals?\n\nDoes your son have an uncle or grandpa, some adult he trusts, who can spend some time with him and help him open up about what’s going on? Can they go to a movie or a ballgame? It takes a village, as they say, and parents are often the wrong messengers for the right message because of the rebellion factor. Also, children need to complain and gripe about their folks a bit; sometimes “delinquency” is a kind of grandiose, covered-up lament or expression of hurt feelings that they feel can’t be expressed any other way.\n\nWhat do the parents of these “bad influences” have to say? The more communication among all of you, the better. You need to know where your son is, within reason, and to let him and his friends know that caring eyes are watching.\n\nAlso, what is your own attitude toward drinking and drug use (including pills)? That may have some bearing on your son, if you or your husband tip too far toward rigidity or looseness; at any rate, his drinking and smoking is a symptom of something deeper, but neither is helpful to his development if overdone.\n\nIt would be interesting to reflect upon how and when the “old version” of your son changed, and what may have been going on in the overall context of his life. We all change. But was there any big change? New neighborhood, new school, the loss of a girlfriend? If he is self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, why? What might be causing anxiety, worry, or other troublesome feelings? Is he worried about dating, college, becoming a man? I think it is important to remember he is still the boy you love, struggling as manhood fast approaches. It’s a confusing world, and teens are bombarded with all kinds of conflicting messages. Personal identity questions around freedom, autonomy, and self-expression are all being worked out, often awkwardly, as a new “family” of peers is developed. Again, the calmer you are—and the less your emotional security is dependent on his behavior—the better.\n\nAlso, what bothers you about this behavior? Are you concerned you or others will deem yourself a parental “failure”? Are you imagining the worst—i.e., he is headed for the penitentiary if this doesn’t stop yesterday? Are you already preparing the care package you’ll take to the visiting center, where he’ll be waiting in an orange jumpsuit? Try not to panic, as this may alienate him and scare him off. I know many productive, happy adults who went through a “dark period” in their teens. In fact, it’s better to get it out of the way now. He could also be testing you, to see how far he can go before losing (or not) your love of him. The trick as parents is loving the child without necessarily condoning certain behavior. Easier said than done. But he is and will always be your boy (even if he doesn’t express it that way). Often in the mid- to late twenties, there is a period of reconciliation where kids, now adults, realize how hard adult life really is.\n\nFinally, the most important point of all, which may sound somewhat counterintuitive (but here goes): Take care of yourself. One thing parents forget, and I include myself here, is that we are most of all role models for our children, even when they act like we’re invisible (or annoying). Sometimes, our children will “counter-identify,” meaning they’ll take on the “reverse” identity of a parent, to distinguish themselves as different. Your son’s behavior is communicating something important to you, most likely unconsciously; it’s a good idea to try to “decode” what he’s trying to say. There’s no harm in some family therapy to seek some help in this.\n\nChildren often bridle at the implication that they are responsible for their parents’ emotional well-being. This only decreases and constrains the very freedom they’re itching to define. Of course parents get upset or angry or anxious when a child is in trouble—that’s normal—but I’m talking about something more profound, a core, existential sense of OK-ness. Parents who feel, consciously or not, that “my child’s ‘performance’ is a direct reflection of my own core worthiness” are setting themselves up for trouble.\n\nI like the concept from recovery programs of “attraction, not promotion.” You want to provide an attraction to a peaceful sense of stability, calm, and strength which you personally embody. Not pounce and pick apart all of his behavior, which will only make him defensive and/or angry. In a way, you and his dad are the guardrails for safety, in deed and not just word. The guardrail needs to be flexible but not breakable, solid but not overly foreboding (or flimsy). Our children provoke our own need to grow and stretch as a person, and again there’s no shame in getting help. This might include therapy, Al-Anon, or a parents’ support group so you can learn from others—which would also be good role modeling for him. And any non-pressured family time, in whatever form (movies, ballgames, let him choose), will hopefully cultivate unity.\n\nFinally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has a page for parents on teens. There are other good resources for parents on the Internet also."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can We Convince My Sister to Dump Her Loser Boyfriend?",
    "Question": "My sister's boyfriend is a complete loser. He has no job at age 28, but his wealthy parents support him anyway, sending him $2,000 a month. He lives with my sister, who is 19, in her apartment. He pays half the rent, but wait until you hear where most of the rest of his money is going: drugs. Surprise! He's got my sister shooting up heroin with him now! She says she's in love with him. She can't see that she's throwing her life away. She thinks we're the problem (her family) and yells at us for \"meddling\" in her messed-up life. Because she's an adult, she thinks she should be able to do whatever she wants. She's too young to recognize the harm she's doing to herself. She wants to drop out of community college and work full-time at a department store. She is well on her way to becoming a junkie. Her boyfriend is a terrible influence on her. Have I mentioned he's been in jail six times and has a suspended driver's license? My parents and I desperately want to get her away from him, but we don't know how to go about it if she stubbornly refuses to leave him. Please help us!",
    "TherapistReply": "I hear your love and concern for your sister. There is nothing more painful than watching someone you love make choices you believe are harmful. Unfortunately, they are her choices. You will not get anywhere with your sister if you lecture her about the choices she is making. Letting her know (directly or indirectly) you think her boyfriend is a “loser” will most likely only serve to distance her from you and strengthen her bond to him. It also makes it less likely she would confide in you if she did have misgivings about her relationship or her choices; nobody wants to hear “I told you so” from anyone, particularly family.\n\nAt 19, your sister is technically an adult. You characterize her behavior as stubborn. That feeling may be contributing to a dynamic that makes her believe you and your parents don’t respect her, don’t see her as a capable adult, and don’t understand her needs. Given that dynamic, of course she isn’t going to listen to you. She may insist on sticking to her (destructive) choices just to prove her independence. As long as you continue to approach her with opposition, little is likely to improve. Also, even if you were successful in “getting rid” of the boyfriend, that is no guarantee her life choices would improve.May I suggest you reach out to her from a different place? Listen to her. Find out from her what works for her in her relationship. What draws her to her boyfriend? Let her know you aren’t trying to “meddle”; you are just trying to understand her choices. Lead from a place of love and compassion, not judgment and fear. You can also ask her if she’d be willing to engage in family therapy with you and your parents to see about changing your family dynamic, independent of the boyfriend.\n\nThe drug use is absolutely a concern. Not only are there potential physical, financial, and legal ramifications for what she is doing, but emotionally, it is likely distancing her more from you and your parents and connecting her more to her boyfriend as well as impacting her ability to make effective choices. Working with a family therapist and an addiction specialist (with or without your sister) can help you identify some effective intervention strategies. Attending a Nar-Anon meeting could also shed some light (again, with or without your sister)."

    "QuestionTitle": "Bah Humbug! Am I a Bad Person for Hating the Holidays?",
    "Question": "It's the holiday season, a time when most people seem to be happy and cheerful. But it is never a happy time for me. I hate the holidays! Forced schmoozing with family I wouldn't otherwise want to see ... an obligation to spend money I don't have on others ... crappy weather. I can see how couples who have kids might be able to appreciate the holidays, but for a single person like me, they're just the worst. It's just a reminder of how single and lonely and adrift I am. Am I a terrible person for feeling down when everyone else seems to be so merry?",
    "TherapistReply": "You are not alone—not everybody loves the holidays, and plenty of people hate them. Thanksgiving is only round one. Not long after, you get socked with a real haymaker, the endgame (literally, December)—Christmas or Kwanzaa or Hanukkah or whatever version of party-on you choose … or that’s been chosen for you, I suppose.\n\nNot to mention it gets really dark really early now and, depending where you live, perhaps freezing cold and snowy. The celebrations you don’t feel part of, plus the longer nights, the light deprivation, and the crappy weather, can cause emotional and physiological reactions that make you feel even worse.\n\nA lot of people struggle with the commercialization of the season as well; many stores set up holiday displays and started piping in seasonal music before summer was out! For many people, the significance of the holidays, or what they’re supposed to stand for, is lost in the hustle and bustle.\n\nNo, you are not a terrible person for feeling down this time of year. A great many people feel depressed and stressed and lonely and grief-stricken and resentful this time of year. It may seem like everybody else is celebrating with special loved ones and you’re not, and you may feel all alone and, worse, obligated to join celebrations you don’t feel are for you. But remember, not everyone has family, not everyone has family they want to spend time with, and not all families have learned to put aside the family drama and just let everybody have a good time together.\n\nThere’s a store near where I live. Every year about this time, they put a sign in their window: “Sharpen your knives for the holidays.” It’s a hardware store, so I read it literally—bring in your knives and we’ll sharpen them right up. But for what? I always wonder. Are those knives for slicing up turkey and ham or for self-defense? Do we kind of feel like turkeys and hams, sitting around the big table with all those relatives we have nothing to say to and who don’t like us much either?Do you have to see your family? Spending time with friends instead can be enjoyable. Would you feel guilty if you did that?\n\nPut aside for a moment family obligations. What would YOU like to do? What would make YOU happy? Some reflection on why, specifically, the holidays are so rough for you may help guide you as you search for ways to get through them. Any form of self-care might do. You deserve to feel taken care of, even if it’s you doing the caretaking.\n\nForget, for a moment, everyone else’s expectations of you—which are probably based on the expectations others have of them, anyway. What are YOUR expectations, both of yourself and of others? The weight of feeling like you have to meet someone else’s expectations can add to heaviness of the holidays. Know what matters to you and strive for that, first and foremost.\n\nOn the other hand, how long do the holidays last? Two dinners together can’t last longer than, say, twelve hours all together? Six hours each, maybe? Of course, in some families, even that much time can feel like an eternity. It may be that you have to set boundaries in order to ensure that your needs are met. This could mean limiting your exposure to family gatherings or festivities in whatever way makes them manageable or palatable. Two hours per event? Three? A $10 limit per gift? No gifts? Whatever you decide, no guilt necessary; you’re simply doing what you need to do.\n\nIs there somebody you can talk to? There is always somebody, even if that person is a therapist, support group, help line, or faith or church community. I can assure you that you are not alone, and that many other people out there would likely find comfort in knowing you feel the same way they do. If you can’t bear the thought of family time, let like-minded people be your tribe this season—a season that will mercifully pass."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Girlfriend Keeps Making Her Pets My Problem",
    "Question": "I do not like animals, but last week my girlfriend brought home a puppy. We already have two cats, and I'm the one who always cleans their litter box and makes sure they have food and water set out all the time. We both work different hours, so now most of my relaxing time at home is disturbed by this dog that is definitely not potty trained yet and just chases the cats around the entire house. My girlfriend loves this dog, so I don't want to make her get rid of it and look like a horrible person in the process, but I also don't want to be stuck training or taking care of it (and I know I will be). What would you do in my situation? I need some professional advice!",
    "TherapistReply": "Before I try to answer your question, I have to come clean. When my husband Mark and I first met 30 years ago I lived with a 7-year-old boy, two snakes, two cats, a dog, a bunch of tropical fish, two turtles, and, if I remember correctly, a couple of hamsters. All this in a typical (read small) Manhattan apartment. After we wed, Mark said, “I didn’t just marry Lynn—I joined her biosphere.”\n\nMark had grown up with almost no pets, except, after much lengthy pleading, a goldfish his mother bought him, and which died pretty fast.\n\nI have never lived without a pet, and I loved all the members of what Mark called my biosphere, even my son’s snakes! I had those creatures before I met Mark, so I did most of the work, which was fair, except Mark kindly walked the dog every morning and sometimes at night, too, and he cleaned out the cat box when I was pregnant. He has learned to feed the livestock if he gets up first, but he refuses to sleep with any animals other than me. That was a blow to me and the cats, but we adjusted.\n\nNow Mark says, “I’ve grown to like the beasts.” When he says this, I think (but do not say), “Beasts? What beasts?”\n\nThe snakes, the dog, the fish, the turtles, and the hamsters all died eventually, and we slowly pared down on livestock, but I cannot bear a house without cats. I have always lived with cats. My earliest happy memory is visiting a mama cat and her newborn babies.\n\nMy thoughts about you and your girlfriend, the dog and the two cats? First off, I think all members of a household, both furry and not so furry, have to agree before adopting anyone new. No one joins up unless everybody is on board. The puppy is the new baby, and I wonder when and how he or she appeared. Was there discussion? The ASPCA and other adoption agencies (pet stores, not so much) try to make sure all family members agree before adding a new member to the family. This protects the furries and the less furry. Cats and dogs are a responsibility, and taking one into your home is like having a child. You are responsible for the animal’s well-being. They deserve love, compassion, and respect—just like humans.Through no fault of their own, furry companions walk into the line of fire and elicit strong emotional reactions between people. The furries become symbols of communication problems. They can be a bridge between their people or they can be a dividing line. This is not fair to anyone.\n\nI suggest that you and your girlfriend have a long and frank talk together, not only about the pets but also (and most importantly) how you connect and make decisions together. You might consider relationship counseling so you can get back on track. The problem is not with the four-legged critters; the problem here is with the bipeds. It’s important that the concerns of both parties be heard—fully heard—by the other.\n\nDr. Joel Gavriele-Gold wrote a book about this called When Pets Come Between Partners: How to Keep Love—and Romance—in the Human/Animal Kingdom of Your Home. You and your girlfriend might want to read it together."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Only Friends Are Homophobic and Don’t Know I’m Gay",
    "Question": "I am a 24-year-old male college student. I am quiet and shy and introverted, and I don't make friends easily. In fact, I really only have two, which I know is pathetic. But because I only have two friends, I think I value my friendships more than most people. The problem in my case is that both of my friends say homophobic things all the time, kind of as playful putdowns of each other. I play along to fit in, but it pains me that I am not being my authentic self. What they don't realize is that I am gay. I haven't told them because I know where they stand on gay people; they think gay marriage is an abomination, and they think being gay is a choice as opposed to something you're born as. I fear that if I tell them I'm gay, they will distance themselves from me and I'll end up being totally friendless in this world. So I guess I don't have a question so much as I am looking for some support, since I won't get it from them. Any thoughts appreciated.",
    "TherapistReply": "Real friends are supportive of one another. You may think that the buddies you hang out with are the ones you need, but I think they are just the ones that are around—friends of convenience more than friends of the heart. Even if they really are good friends in many ways, I hope you’ll be able to find friends you can be real with, as they can be with you.\n\nThese two are not enough for you; you’re not satisfied, nor should you be. It might behoove you to step around a bit, gently challenge your tendency to be alone, reach out, and try to connect with other people. One or two more people to hang with might make a big difference, especially if they are genuine and expect you to simply be yourself. That might sound difficult, and for many introverted people, it is indeed difficult. It sounds like you could really benefit from connection, though, and connection does take some effort and perhaps even discomfort. That discomfort is not unique to you; many people struggle with finding people they can click with. There are websites, of course, that try to assist with this, and to minimize any angst involved.\n\nIn any case, one or two close friends can be enough if the relationships are honest, deep, and true, but 100 friends who are not authentic are not enough because the relationships are essentially empty; they aren’t nourishing and supportive, as they should be. You’re looking for real friends who are capable of deep and honest feelings.How can you find real friends? You say you are shy and introverted and that making friends is difficult; I can feel what that’s like, and it gets lonely sometimes. (On the other hand, the ability to enjoy being alone and introspective can be a gift.) What can you do, though, when you want to hang out with somebody? Some people find a place or a person or a situation where help is needed and then they provide it. They might join an organization devoted to feeding the homeless, for example, and volunteer their services. Or they might join the service society in their school. If you need help, give help, as you’ll probably wind up getting help.\n\nIf you’re with people who have a purpose that’s directed outward, and your attention is directed outward too, it is a bit easier to be friendly because you have a common goal, which gives you all something to talk about. Another benefit of a common goal is that it can take everybody’s attention away from themselves and turn the focus instead to an activity that will help them arrive at the goal. This makes many people feel more comfortable, as the situation expands to include much outside of themselves. The idea is to find something that is bigger than yourself, which helps you feel less self-conscious, eventually, and gives you something that bonds you together with others.\n\nFinding a group that bonds around a common interest can help, too. This interest could be anything—music, chess, old movies, basketball. Look around and you’ll find a place for yourself, or you’ll make a place for yourself and find that others may join you. After all, you’re not the only person feeling shy and introverted; others feel that way, too.\n\nWhat you give can be what you get, so my recommendation is to find somebody who needs a friend and be one for that person."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Do I ‘Troll’ People on the Internet and How Can I Stop?",
    "Question": "I guess I am one of those people you'd call a \"troll\"—I post mean and insulting things online anonymously to people I don't know. In the evenings, my livelihood is to get on YouTube, find videos by vloggers, especially female ones, and leave comments about them. I make fun of their appearance, insult their intelligence, and call them out if they're gay. I don't even believe most of the stuff I write. Being removed from their lives makes me feel like I can safely degrade them and make them feel terrible about what they're doing and how they're making money. But most of the time, it's not even really about them; it's just funny sometimes to have the power to rile up the crowd of other people watching these videos, because they get so mad! I'm not a mean person in \"real life,\" though. I live with my parents and do lash out at them sometimes, but I've never really been a bully in person or anything. I know it's not right to attack people, and I'd like to know why I do it and how to stop. Can you help?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for reaching out with this powerful question. There are a number of reasons you may be engaging in this behavior, and I hope this response helps you to uncover some of what motivates it so that you can change it.\n\nWhen behind the computer screen, it’s very easy for people to engage in behaviors they would never do in real life. The anonymity of the Internet offers a shield—some people feel as if they can be aggressive, and in some cases abusive, toward others because they don’t feel as though they are hurting a real person. One strange thing about the Internet is that while we are incredibly connected digitally, we are very disconnected interpersonally. The fact you can’t see the people you interact with online makes it easier to “other” them. When we “other” people, we don’t necessarily see them as real people with real feelings, and that makes it easier to disconnect from the reality that our words can cause actual harm.\n\nThere is also a sense of the Internet being consequence free; you are largely anonymous, and unless someone is really motivated to find you, you’re likely to get away with this type of behavior. It is easy to see how slippery the slope can be when these two factors are combined. When they feel anonymous, people often do things they would not do in their daily lives. Those things we do when we feel anonymous are often impulses we have in daily life that are socially unacceptable or that we have been told are not allowed. When you are making these comments and “trolling” people, you likely have at least a couple of people who agree with you, which may make your behavior seem more acceptable. That could be another factor in why this is an issue for you.Perhaps the bigger issue here is why you feel the need to engage in these ways. Based on what you wrote, it seems as if you may get a thrill from feeling powerful and feeling as though you can whip up a frenzy just by what you say. That leads me to wonder if perhaps you are feeling less than powerful in your daily life and if this is a way for you to assert yourself. Given that you are also occasionally snappy with your parents, it may be that your life situation is one that causes you to seek power in whatever way you can find it and the Internet is an easy source.\n\nI suggest a few things: First, seek out a qualified therapist in your area with whom you can address these feelings/impulses. Next, whenever you find yourself trolling, take the time to remind yourself that the person on the other end is a real person, with real feelings, real family, friends, and loved ones. There have been cases where people, whose emotional states we simply can’t know, have been driven to extreme despair, even suicide, due to cyber bullying. Given that you’ve reached out for help, which is courageous and admirable, I’m confident you don’t want to be one of the people who contribute to such tragic outcomes.\n\nPlease seek out the support of a therapist to find out what’s compelling you and to take steps to stop the behaviors that motivated you to write. It will likely be good for both you and the people on the other side of the screen."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Feel Like I Don’t Deserve My Husband and He’ll Leave",
    "Question": "My husband and I have been married for almost a year. Sometimes I can't believe my good fortune. He is a wonderful man, great with my kids (I brought two into the marriage), seems to adore me, treats me wonderfully, great provider for the family. Somehow, though, I am always fighting this nagging feeling that he will one day look for something better (if he isn't doing so already) and move on from me. It's like I don't feel like I deserve him. Maybe I don't. I have had some difficult relationships in the past and I hurt a couple of my partners very deeply, cheating on both multiple times. I grew up in a home where my dad cheated on my mom, ditching her (and me) in the end, and I grew up vowing that if anyone gets hurt in my relationships, it won't be me. But I have changed my ways. I have been completely faithful to my current husband. I love him dearly. I cannot imagine hurting him. But I can imagine him hurting me. Despite the evidence in front of me every day, I am convinced it's just a matter of time. What's my problem?",
    "TherapistReply": "I think you have quite a bit of insight about your problem: your childhood experiences and past relationships have shaped your worldview in such a way that you don’t trust your current reality.\n\nYou have made yourself vulnerable by committing to not hurting your husband—and that feels scary to you. We all carry some baggage from our formative experiences into current relationships. It seems, however, that your fears are preventing you from enjoying your relationship as you could. I imagine you find yourself in a pretty constant state of anxiety or fear—watching and waiting for evidence that you might get hurt. That’s exhausting. It also can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. We expect someone to tire of us, and we push for reassurance or we accuse them of not caring enough until they do tire of our behaviors and disengage from the relationship. That then confirms what we believed all along—that people will hurt us and leave us.\n\nMost people will leave us if we push them away hard enough. The challenge is not to push when we feel scared or vulnerable, but to engage and connect.There is no quick fix or easy answer to your question. I recommend that you find a therapist to work through your relationship fears and feelings of self-worth. There is quite a bit of healing that will likely need to happen before you can fully embrace being in relationship with another person.\n\nTo accept love, you must feel worthy of love. It sounds as if that may be a significant part of your struggles. You can talk with a therapist about how to bring your husband into the work you do together—as he can likely be a great support for you. If he understands your triggers and how to respond most effectively to you, that can only enhance your relationship. However, I do not suggest focusing on couples work. I think you would benefit first and foremost from individual work to address your concerns."

    "QuestionTitle": "A Child Smeared Poop in Our Home; Should I Tell Her Parents?",
    "Question": "Last week, my husband's sister and her family stayed with us in our five-bedroom house. Their daughter, age 8, had a guest bedroom to herself. After they left, I was cleaning that room and discovered a substance on the wall that wasn't there before. Not knowing what it was, I tried to smudge it off with my finger and then smelled it. My heart almost stopped when I realized it was human excrement! It was on the wall near the closet and also near the bed. It could not have gotten there by accident. The girl must have intentionally smeared it there. I am shocked and upset. She seems like a nice girl otherwise, though the family has alluded to some developmental concerns without going into detail. My question is, should I call the family and let them know what I found, or should I just clean it up, move on, and save everyone (the girl included) the embarrassment? Is it the sign of a mental health problem? It's gross and unsanitary, but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and I don't want to get anyone mad at me.",
    "TherapistReply": "How upsetting to make such a discovery! It is unusual, developmentally, for an 8-year-old to smear feces on the wall, though I would hesitate to jump to the conclusion of mental health issues or other concerns without having more information.\n\nIt doesn’t sound as if there has been a lot of open communication between your families historically. If that is the case, I can understand your hesitation. It sounds as if you are trying to be sensitive to their feelings, which is admirable. If, however, there are some developmental or behavioral concerns, it is important that her parents are fully informed so that they can take appropriate steps to get her the support she needs.My recommendation would be to share the information in as nonjudgmental a way as possible. You can mention what you found, express that it puzzled you, and that you just wanted them to be aware. Be sure to avoid jumping to conclusions or making accusations about intent. Sticking to the facts can make it easier to present difficult information. You said she “seems like a nice girl otherwise”—she likely IS a nice girl, and while it may be difficult to fathom what led to her actions, the simplest way to find out what happened is to ask.\n\nIt might be an awkward conversation. The parents might react defensively or with embarrassment. They may also appreciate knowing. What does your husband think? It is his sister and her family, after all. Does he have suggestions on what approach might work best? Would it be easier if the information came from him?\n\nYou also may want to consider what you would want if the roles were reversed. If it were your child, would you rather find out right away, thus allowing you the opportunity to respond to your child’s needs? Think about what it might be like the next time they visit. Would you feel comfortable putting her in the guest room again? Chances are, this incident would come up, and then the embarrassment and awkwardness could be coupled with frustration at not having heard about it before."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Husband Refuses to Unfriend a Woman He Flirted With",
    "Question": "My husband and I have been married 40 years. Recently I happened to notice a conversation on Facebook that he left open on our shared computer. I would describe it as extremely flirtatious, but there were no signs of a full-blown affair. The woman appeared to be in her early fifties. When I asked my husband about it, he turned beet red and apologized for my having seen the conversation. He said she's an old classmate of his from high school and that she \"friended\" him about a month ago. He said they were just flirting harmlessly. However, it doesn't feel harmless to me. I am hurt. He hasn't flirted with me like that in decades. I asked him point blank if he has any romantic feelings for her. He said, \"If I were single, maybe, but I am not and that is that.\" That made me feel a little better, but only a little. It made me think that maybe he's been thinking about what life would be like if we were no longer married. It made me think he has thought about what it would like to be with her. So I asked him to \"unfriend\" her and to no longer have contact with her. He laughed and said I have nothing to worry about and I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. He refuses to unfriend her, accused me of being \"controlling,\" and says it's not his fault that I have a problem with the situation. I think it is his fault. What am I to do? I feel completely disrespected and devalued that he won't grant me the simple gesture of removing from our lives a source of worry that he helped create. Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your letter. I am sure that it hurt your feelings, to say the least, when your husband laughed at your request to remove the woman from his Facebook friends list. I also think that, while your feelings are very understandable, this woman is in some ways a red herring for both of you. My sense is that something is missing from the marriage and your feeling undervalued might be there with or without the online classmate. Somehow, his flirtation only exacerbated a feeling of disrespect and devaluing—a big “ouch” for anyone.\n\nFirst of all, “extremely flirtatious” sounds concerning. From what you saw, did it stray into the sexually explicit? Did they toy with the idea of taking things a step further—“Hey, at the next class reunion, you and I will have our own private stroll down memory lane,” or something along those lines? It is hard to make a judgment about this secondhand, though again the important thing is your hurt feelings and the sense of being in second place (yikes). We all want to feel we’re “the one” with our partner. I also, though, wonder if his leaving it open for you to read was an unconscious communication of a kind, a signal to you that he wants these kinds of conversations with you and not her. An indirect distress call of sorts, or maybe even a protest bordering on the passive-aggressive. If this is truly a “secretive” relationship, he’s not being very secretive about it.\n\nAs for marital drift, I can’t tell you how common an issue this is for long-term marriages. Routine and day-to-day security is a double-edged sword: it is comforting, but it can dull our appreciation of who we’re with. We feel secure in knowing what to expect, that our partner is there for us, day in and day out … and may also begin to wish for something a little more vivid and emotionally satisfying, since our partner is always there day in and day out. Routines both soothe and lull us into complacency. Plus, if someone is “always there,” there may be little urgency regarding sex. Sex and physical intimacy (touching, cuddling) can wait until later, or the next day, tomorrow, maybe this weekend, next week … etc. Perhaps, then, this incident is an opportunity to rekindle something. Your husband obviously means a great deal to you, and I have the feeling a little freshness in the romance department could liven things up.\n\nI’m thinking of at least two things to possibly try, depending on the state of affairs. First, more superficially, you could try something spontaneous that you both find a turn-on, something outside the usual routine—a weekend getaway somewhere you both like, some lingerie or a sexy movie you can watch together (and no, we’re never too old), back rubs, an old role-playing game you haven’t tried in a while. These are just some of the first things that come to mind. Laughter, too, can be sexy. Perhaps you both need a night out at the comedy club, or dance lessons (my wife’s favorite), followed by a nice dinner while sharing memories. There’s also massage: a foot rub with massage lotion can do wonders, taking a bath together with candles, and so on. Again, these are more surface things, but sometimes a little spark is all that’s needed.Or it could be that what’s needed is way of addressing the depths of your feelings and the concern over a strained connection; you may want to sit him down, at a time that works for both of you, and spell out as calmly and non-accusingly as you can what it is you feel and would like to see happen, to make sure he really understands your concerns and how this episode has hurt. I recommend approaching this as partners who are seeking to strengthen the bonds of “the team.” (Rather than “you’re my problem here,” it’s “distance is our problem here.”) Try to keep the focus on you as much as you can, rather than that online woman. He is married to you, not her, but you’re not feeling it lately. You miss him as the man you love, and want to feel him as your chosen partner, not (I’m just guessing) your roommate. You can also mention that when he laughs and dismisses the idea, it feels minimizing and perhaps even abandoning.\n\nI would emphasize avoiding concrete solutions at first—i.e., to “unfriend” her or not—until after you have shared feelings and listened and tried to understand how the other feels. Jumping into concrete details will dilute the more essential task of understanding each other’s perspectives and hopes, fears, desires, etc., at play in the marriage as of today.\n\nTry asking him for his perspective, and—here’s the hard part—try and listen as openly as you can. Imagine, for a moment, you are a friend and not his wife. Is there something bugging him about the relationship? What does he think may be going on here? What was it he found with this friend and not you that can, hopefully, be sparked in the marriage? Does he understand how hurtful it was to stumble upon this online “chat”? I hope that such a dialogue would strengthen your bond, since hurt feelings can also be a catalyst for a couple’s coming closer together with deeper understanding.\n\nIt is often a turn-on to feel one’s partner understands how they feel, what they desire, and what hurts. Then we have not just a partner but an ally, someone in our corner who knows our heart, warts and all, and loves and accepts us for who we are. I hope you and your husband are able to find some of this … and there’s no shame in seeking out some couples counseling if the two of you need a little assistance sharing and hearing each other. Sometimes, even just a handful of sessions, with a focus on empathic and reflective listening, can help."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Deal with Younger, Competitive People at Work?",
    "Question": "Hi. I am seeking some advice in regard to strong personality types in the workplace. New staff have recently joined our organization, and a majority of them have strong personalities. By this, I mean they are overbearing, they have a sense of entitlement, have a strong sense of self-belief, are seemingly self-confident, zealous in their approach to their work, and vocal. They are competent individuals. The \"softer\" personality types, myself included, are finding the strong personalities challenging to deal with in a work setting, due in part to their overbearing and competitive nature. My workplace style is noncompetitive, but rather cooperative. I am gregarious and genuinely care about people, and some of these new colleagues seem to demand attention and are seemingly self-serving. Their age range is roughly 25 to 40, and we are all equal in rank, perform the same tasks, work in a team of 12, and work in a cultural/tourism environment. Most of the \"softer\" personalities are over 40. Any tips you can provide on how I can best deal with this matter would be very much appreciated.",
    "TherapistReply": "You describe yourself as cooperative, gregarious, and caring. These are the strengths I hope you will use to help yourself and your colleagues—the old ones and the new ones—so you can work together to develop a new work family system.\n\nIt is very difficult when a few new people join a workplace at about the same time, especially as they may seem to have more in common with one another than with the longer-term employees. You write that their age range is roughly 25 to 40 and that they are younger than you and your “softer” friends. I’m guessing there is a generation gap, and that different styles and ways of being are in conflict. If so, it might help to talk things out together, perhaps with a professional mediator if things get too hot.\n\nPerhaps those people who have been working at your office longer may feel that their status is threatened. This is not an uncommon response to change in the workplace. The task for each and all of you is to find common ground so you can work together and get along.\n\nYou describe the new people as strong personalities with a “sense of entitlement” and a zealous approach; overbearing but also competent, equally competent to you and your friends. Is there parity in your compensation and benefits? I am curious as to all the reasons they seem so “other.”I wonder, too, if the new people have new ideas, new approaches, and new ways of doing things that may seem to challenge the more established procedures. This can be annoying and shake things and people up, but you can all also benefit from their “newness” by seeing things from a different perspective, which might be an asset. If the new crowd has new ideas, it would benefit everyone to give those ideas a forum where they can be explored and perhaps even worked out.\n\nSo my advice is to take some deep breaths and take a step back. You have a lot to offer, and can use your personality, experience, and wisdom to nurture the new arrivals and help create a warmer work space.\n\nYou’re describing an “us vs. them” situation, which never works. I’m hoping that your “softer” personality may be just the thing that helps people work together and blend the lines between the “old” and the new."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Husband Yells at Me When I Mention Our Lack of Sex",
    "Question": "My husband, who I have been married to for less than two years, rarely makes love to me or shows me affection. He shouts at me when I bring the subject up and asks me if I want a divorce. I'm sure the neighborhood hears him shouting. All I want is love, affection, and some lovemaking once in a while. It makes me very insecure, and I worry that he is no longer attracted to me. He is 61 and I am 63. Help!",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your message and for having the courage to reach out. I’m sorry to hear that your marriage has run into some challenging times. I hope this message will prove useful and will help you find some solutions.\n\nWhen partners seem to lose interest, it is natural for the other party to feel as though perhaps it has something to do with them. While that may be the case in some situations, it is not always that way. Often, it may have absolutely nothing to do with the partner.\n\nThere are many reasons people might lose interest in sexual activity—work stress, financial trouble, and physical issues are just a few possible reasons. Before assuming that your husband is no longer sexually interested in you, consider that there may be something else going on.\n\nThe first question that comes up for me is whether your husband might be experiencing some erectile dysfunction issues that may be getting in the way of his sexual interest/willingness. If that is the case, he may be embarrassed and masking it with anger. For some men, the loss of the ability (or decreased ability) to function sexually is a significant blow to their masculinity. Of course, I have no idea if this is the case, but it is worth considering. There may be any number of other causes. Sometimes, people lose interest in sexual contact with their partner if the partner changes his or her physical appearance, hurts them deeply, or if they feel somehow unsafe in the marriage. As you can see, the possibilities for why your husband may not be interested in sexual contact right now are many, and until you do some exploration, you may not have the answer you’re seeking.My suggestion to you is that you step into a place of compassion and understanding, and with gentle curiosity ask your husband if he can set aside the anger and talk to you about what is going on. Let him know that you love him and want to meet him where he is but you must know what’s happening with him. Let him know that you are not judging him, not taking it personally, and simply want to understand so you can know how to proceed.\n\nIf he remains unwilling to talk, you may want to consider seeking out a therapist who can help you decide what steps to take next.\n\nWhen you approach your husband, be sure to do it at a neutral time. Whatever you do, don’t approach him right after he refuses sex, because that is a high-tension time. I suggest you set a time with him, a few days or even a week in advance, when you can talk. If you both work and have stressful weeks, maybe choose a weekend time. When the time comes, sit down in a quiet place, free of distractions, and begin the discussion. If things get heated or tense, it’s always OK to take a brief “timeout” to cool down and come back to it. With a difficult topic like this one, it may take a few tries to discuss it fully, but a peaceful and satisfying resolution will be worth the effort.\n\nHowever, you know your situation better than I do. The shouting you mention is concerning. If you ever feel unsafe with your husband or have any indication he could be physically violent, consider calling the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 and/or finding a safe place to stay, at least until things calm down."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Stay Strong Knowing My Wife Has Terminal Cancer?",
    "Question": "A couple of weeks ago, my wife of four years drove herself to the emergency room complaining about a burning sensation in her midsection. A battery of tests later, doctors found lesions on her pancreas and liver that were biopsied and determined to be cancerous. She is Stage 4, and the prognosis is terminal. She is 37! She has anywhere from a few months to a year or so, depending on how she reacts to chemotherapy. Needless to say, my world has been turned upside-down—hers too, obviously. I thought we'd have a lifetime together, and here we are facing this greatest of challenges that doctors say cannot be overcome, just delayed. She's a fighter, and I'm sure that will maximize our time together, and I took an indefinite leave of absence from work to be with her and help her. I cannot imagine what she is feeling and going through. I am trying not to let her see how much I am struggling with this. It's still sinking in, of course, but all I want to do is weep and hide and weep some more. I can't cry in front of her and get her down, though. She hasn't yet accepted this diagnosis, but her spirits are better than mine would be, at least on the outside. How do I support my wife through this difficult time without breaking down and taking her with me? How do I grieve and be strong at the same time? How can I be what she needs me to be if I'm always on the verge of losing it? Please help me.",
    "TherapistReply": "I am so sorry to hear about your situation, and cannot imagine the pain you and your wife must be experiencing as she fights her battle against cancer. Let’s get to the root of your questions.\n\nYou love each other. You can’t help being what she needs you to be—she needs you to be you, loving her, and you clearly do. Yes, you will be optimistic if you can and if that helps. Yes, you can cry in front of her after she has had sufficient time to digest the news, and you can cry together to mourn the life that you will not have together, as well as to celebrate the life you have together now and have had to this point. You are grieving. Of course you are grieving. Please allow yourself to grieve in whatever way you need to. Although you say your wife is acclimating to the news better than you are, it’s possible she’s trying to stay “strong” for you, and is grieving inside every bit as much as you are. It’s OK to grieve together. In fact, it could be very helpful. Talk to your wife about what you are feeling and see how she feels about experiencing your grief as a team.\n\nYou describe your wife as a fighter, and you sound like you are one, too. You will find ways to be together and do the things you love best. And in those times when grieving in front of your wife doesn’t feel like the thing to do, when you need to scream and holler and let go, it’s absolutely OK to find a private place and do so. You can walk down a busy city street and yell your heart out (I’ve done this myself), or you can hide in the woods and do the same. You can lean on a good friend or family member who will help you mourn and be angry and be thankful, and break apart and heal and hold together.\n\nYou have time still to show your love, to enjoy the everyday-ness of being together. Four years may be a pittance of the time you wished you might have, but it’s also a treasure chest of breakfasts and dinners, fights and laughs, walks and longer journeys, complaints and compliments. You will be brave and cowardly, angry and loving, and express all the emotions that humans are capable of feeling, and you will do so both together and separately. All of it is OK. All of it is normal. All of it is whatever you make of it. Please let yourself feel what you feel.\n\nYour wife needs help, yes, but don’t forget that you do, too. You need and deserve supportive people—family, friends, perhaps even groups who will help you through this. You can’t do it alone.\n\nMany hospitals have support groups where people meet and help one another through difficult times. Are you members of a religious or spiritual group? Would you consider working privately with a therapist or counselor—someone just for you, or someone for you both? I highly recommend the empathic support of a therapist to help guide you through the range of emotions you’re feeling right now, especially a therapist who specializes in grief, loss, and bereavement.\n\nI hope you can feel the love and peace that I wish you both."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Upset Should I Be If I Was Hired Because I’m a Minority?",
    "Question": "I am a recent college graduate, 22 years old, and Latino. I have always been a good student. I had a 3.73 grade-point average in high school and a 3.84 in college. Unlike a lot of my college friends, I was fortunate to find a good job straight out of university. Most of my friends are having a really hard time finding good work. Some even moved back in with their parents. I know I'm lucky. But I am also smart and resourceful, and I work very hard. So imagine my disappointment when one of my new coworkers told me I was hired partly because I am a minority. Several coworkers and I went out for drinks after work last week and told me about the hiring process for my position. I guess there were hundreds of applicants. All of the finalists were white except for me. One of the other finalists had more experience and even had two degrees, including a master's. From everything I've been told, this guy had a stronger profile than me. The guy who told me about this said there has been a corporate mandate to diversify. He didn't say this in such a way to make me upset and he tried to reassure me that I am a great hire. But my office is very white. There is me, one black woman, and about 30 white people. Of course I noticed the lack of diversity when I was hired, but I didn't consider the possibility that one of the factors they liked about me was my race. I am glad I got hired, but I am upset that there is a possibility that it wasn't entirely on merit. I did not want to be hired to be a token of diversity. I wanted to be hired because I have a lot to offer and I deserve it. I know that there are many minorities who are discriminated against by employers, so my mom thinks I should be happy that things went my way, even if my race was a factor. She says they wouldn't have hired me if I couldn't do the job. I guess I wonder: How offended should I be? Should I talk to my supervisor or HR department about this? Since I'm new, I don't really want to rock the boat or get on someone's bad side.",
    "TherapistReply": "Wow, that’s a really tough issue to face. I’m glad you wrote, and I hope I can help you out some.\n\nMy first question is how do these colleagues know about the hiring process? Many companies encourage a strict confidentiality for human resources to avoid this very issue, and I am concerned that this information seems to be readily available and that it was shared openly.\n\nSecond, with regard to your question of being hired on your merit and the frustration you’re feeling, it’s important to remember that affirmative action was put into place because, historically, minorities have a harder time being employed. Studies have shown that résumés with minority names get 50% fewer callbacks for interviews than white-sounding names. Some people call this “everyday racism,” and it is one of the ways racism becomes systematic. You mentioned that there is a company mandate to diversify, and it sounds like the company sorely needs it and your hire may be one of the ways they are attempting to rectify it.\n\nIt could also be that you were the strongest candidate and the information you received is faulty. I question why your colleagues would feel it necessary to share this information with you and what they hoped to gain by doing so.\n\nI also wonder whether this experience has activated some part of you, a part you’re not necessarily conscious of, that harbors feelings of inadequacy. Most people don’t get through life without taking on some of that in childhood, through no fault of their own. It’s important to recognize feelings that might be triggering and to remind yourself of your own value, even in the face of signs and experiences that may seem devaluing. You know you’re worthy of this position; as you said, you’re smart, resourceful, and a hard worker. If your employer didn’t know that before you were hired, it surely does by now.\n\nAs far as whether you should go to Human Resources, that is a deeply personal decision. Do you think you can work at this company with this awareness and the accompanying questions? Will you be able to live with the answer if they acknowledge that they hired you based on your status as a minority? Are you comfortable working in an environment where deeply personal and private conversations such as why a person was hired over another are made common knowledge?It seems to me that this great opportunity has been tainted for you, and understandably so. It may be worthwhile to have a conversation with HR to express your concerns. At the very least, they may make some changes in how information is protected. As you noted, you may be seen as “rocking the boat” if you do that and some people might not like it. It may make for a challenging work environment, but you have to weigh whether the benefit of speaking up is more than the possible cost.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a situation many minorities still have to deal with and there’s still a long way to go in terms of eliminating racism. There are many who have the same questions you do and who feel they have to work harder or perform better to prove they deserve what they have gotten. It’s not an easy situation to be in, so I encourage you to call upon your support system to help you process this situation and your feelings about it. It might also be worthwhile to seek out a therapist who can help you further process what you’re feeling.\n\nI encourage you to take care of yourself while you decide what to do—rest well, spend time with loved ones, and do what makes you feel good. After you’ve allowed yourself to process and release some of the emotional charge, if you decide to go to HR, you will be grounded, confident, and responsive, and less likely to be offended or reactive."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Tell My Wife about an Affair That Ended Long Ago?",
    "Question": "I have been with my wife for 22 years. About five years into our marriage, I had an intense affair that lasted almost two years. My wife never knew. My wife and I have grown closer and closer as the years have passed, and I can't imagine being with anyone else. She's the love of my life, without a doubt. We do everything together and we're more in love today than we were on our wedding day. My question is whether it's a good idea to come clean to my wife about the affair all those years ago. On the one hand, ignorance is bliss, but on the other hand, I feel terribly guilty and ashamed for having cheated on her and keeping it a secret for so long. I don't know how she'd react. She might forgive me, or she might question everything she knows about our relationship and ... who knows? I feel in my heart that I should tell her and it might even make us stronger. But the thought of hurting my wife kills me. And if she didn't react as well to the revelation as I hope she would, I cannot bear the thought of pushing her away or losing her. Is the risk of telling my wife about my misdeeds (hurting her, maybe losing her) worth the possible reward (lifting of my guilt and shame)? Or should I chalk it up to a lesson learned, leave the past in the past, and just appreciate what we have today? Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your question. It does indeed sound as though the vice-like grip of guilt has taken hold. Painful, indeed. As Pete Campbell from Mad Men said in the show’s final season regarding having an extramarital fling or affair, “It feels good, and then it doesn’t.”\n\nI suppose some might advise you to not tell your wife under any circumstances, that telling her can only cause grievous harm and would only be for your own benefit (such is the certainty of most advice columnists). This may prove to be the wisest path, although before I personally go there, I would be curious about a couple of things. First, what is it that prompted you to stray? It could be any number of things, both general to early marriage and specific to you personally. What stressors were present in and outside the relationship? Some who have experienced past relational injuries or trauma (in childhood, for example) can, later in adult life, find sustained marital intimacy challenging, to the point where some feelings and desires appear or feel “shameful”—needs that, it seems, can be met only outside the relationship, which unfortunately ends most often in regret, guilt, and more shame.\n\nWhat might have been causing distance between the two of you? And are any of those issues present today? Assuming it always takes two, what do you imagine to be your “side” of the issue—and has this problem or obstacle been resolved? Is this aspect of the relationship (on either side) still an issue?\n\nCould this be what is bothering you today, that this “part” of yourself (however it manifests) might still be unacceptable to your wife, and that by sharing about the affair you’re also testing to see if this particular aspect of yourself is accepted by your wife?\n\nOr is it that you were a different person then, and that this past issue has no bearing on the relationship as it exists today, but that you’re anticipating possible fallout if she were to find out … so better to just come clean?\n\nIf the problem no longer exists, it may be wiser to sort it out with your own conscience before taking the complicated and highly unpredictable step of discussing it with your wife, assuming you decide to do so. I think it would be hard to say if or when she would forgive you; she might, but she might not, or it might take years. You, of course, know her better than I do. What is it you feel will help the relationship by telling her? If it is more a matter of your own conscience, is she the best person to offer forgiveness or redemption?\n\nWhat is always keenly ironic to me is that sometimes partners will stray outside the relationship to “protect” the partner from those shameful or unwanted parts that we are sure will offend the other. We fear being too “needy,” too “kinky” in bed, too angry, too sad, and so on. Those emotional needs and feelings thus find a home outside the relationship, making it more likely that the relationship will suffer, possibly fatally.\n\nKeep in mind your wife may very well, like many partners, take the affair as a rejection of her, proof of her own inadequacy still existing today. In other words, it’s quite possible the affair will feel to her—though it’s long over for you—as if it just happened. This will be new information for her, possibly turning the perception of the marriage on its head. I am curious as to what the benefit of this might be, given the risk. Perhaps deciding how you feel about the affair will make it easier to discuss with your wife, should you go that route. I don’t know that it would be up to her to resolve your own conscience on the matter.\n\nIn other words, you may not get the peace of mind and redemption you’re seeking, so perhaps it’s best to make peace with this as best you can before seeking out her forgiveness—because it could take months or years, and meanwhile you’ll be in the same pressure-packed boat while she figures out how to feel about it. Unless by telling her you feel you both might be “in the same boat”?\n\nThe other thing that occurred to me is that the impulse to tell her might, even unconsciously, be a way of creating distance again. Some might call it self-sabotage, though I’m not so crazy about that term as such sabotage might also be, on some level, protecting us from intolerable uncertainty and vulnerability. Again, if intimacy is challenging (as it is for most of us in one way or another), there is a part of us that both craves and fears closeness, lest the injuries or abandonments of the past play out again (not literally, but via new hurts or slights that press our old buttons). Maybe it’s as if you’re saying, “Well, OK, you love me, but do you really love me? Try this on for size!” This might spring from a historically recurring question of whether you really “deserve” the intimacy or love you crave and have found now. If it ain’t broke … as the old saying goes. But sometimes, our deep fear of injury or (symbolic) reinjury leads us to distance ourselves or evade our partner in all manner of ways. In other words, is this a genuine, heartfelt question or a desire to rock the boat in disguise? Maybe both?\n\nBehind the morality of “do I or do I not deserve love” lies the deep fear of being rejected or exiled from our beloved, since we have so little control over the love given to us by others. Do you have a fear of receiving love in general, or dread sustained vulnerability? Could it be you are still upset with your wife about something, and telling her this news is a way of transmitting a feeling of betrayal you have felt but never expressed? If so, is there a different way of doing it, as the fact of the affair itself might well be a red herring, since the truth likely lies less with the what and more with the why of it.It’s also true that infidelity often happens early in a relationship, where a sustained commitment of love and intimacy is frightening to a person. I cannot tell you how many couples I have seen where one partner strayed shortly before or after an engagement or marriage, especially (ironically) when such engagement or marriage was something long-desired. The only thing scarier than not getting what you want, sometimes, is getting what you want.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I think you are struggling with, quite possibly, an existential or highly personal rather than relational question. Before deciding whether to take it to your wife, try discussing this with a therapist (even if it’s only short-term), trusted friend, or spiritual counselor. My sense is that we first have to get right with our own conscience—or make best efforts—before handing that power over to someone who might need time to understand or get over their own hurt. A partner always has their own subjective filter, and it is hard to see how his or her perspective will or won’t align with ours. (It also occurs to me that your wife may end up forgiving you in a way that feels almost dismissive to you, like, “Well, it’s in the past, let’s move on,” which could feel dismissive of your current angst.)\n\nYou say the affair is “over,” but something about it remains very much alive for you. What is it, and is it more about yourself and your own long-standing personal history, or more relating to the relationship specifically? I’m sure there is overlap, but still these questions are probably worth some self-reflection.\n\nYou could even try writing out a “confession,” in as honest a way as possible, and then read it to yourself a few days later (or, again, to a trusted confidant). Then imagine being in her shoes and hearing it for the first time. You might ask, how does this serve the “we” and not just the “me”? Who might benefit, really; are you seeking a redemption that—for a while, at least—she may not be able to give? This way, you can make a decision, fraught with emotional risk, that you have thought through and reflected upon as best you can."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Feel So Guilty about Leaving My Husband, but Leave I Must",
    "Question": "I've been married to my husband for seven years, with him for eight. We have two children together. During this time, I have been the one to hold things together. He has lied to me about money, leaving me to pay the brunt of bills or borrow from family. He almost died last year because of alcohol abuse but started drinking again two weeks after being released from the ICU; this was despite the doctors' warnings to him. I do everything for everyone. He doesn't help me with the kids, doesn't know what to do to take care of me or his family. I have constant migraines, chest pains, anxiety, and I cry all the time. I am broken, depressed, and I feel used, unloved, and unappreciated. So I made a decision to move with my mom. We move this week. I haven't told my husband, and I don't know how he will take the news. I have penned a letter explaining why I am leaving. I plan to stay at a family member's house until my move date. He has three days to find a place to stay. He's been dependent on me to do everything for him, so I don't even know if he has money to fend for himself. I feel I am making the right decision for me and my kids, but I feel so amazingly guilty as I struggle knowing I will be leaving him in a vulnerable state. I feel so hateful leaving him to do the things he doesn't know how to do. I want to put him up in a hotel or pay extra rent for him to stay in the house longer, even though I can't afford it. I feel mean and spiteful, like I'm abandoning him. This is in spite of all the hurt and pain he's put me through for the past eight years. I still love him. Please help me figure out how to best deal with my guilt, my hurt, and my pain. I love my husband so much, but I really don't think he loves me the same. I have to learn to love me more and stop being taken for granted and used. I don't want to sit and watch the man I love drink himself to death. My kids shouldn't have to. I don't want them to grow up and live the same painful life. I feel I have to do this, but again, I feel so guilty.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your honesty in describing what sounds like an unbearably painful situation. Alcoholism and addiction basically put both the addicted person and his or her loved ones in an impossible position, where the addicted one is both there and not there, leaving the partner and loved ones to have a “split” experience with, it often seems, two or more personalities. Those who love people with addictions often have a glimpse of the “real” or true person, who is suffering and appears to want help, before the drunk or stoned person appears again: critical or self-centered to the extreme, and hurtful to be around. Thus, by distancing ourselves from the latter, we also seemingly end up abandoning the former—the sober person we fell in love with. This leaves us in a no-win position, where we can stay and feel continually abandoned ourselves (or attacked, or both) or leave and bear the burden of guilt that tells us we are leaving our loved one alone on a deserted island.\n\nIt is also devastatingly difficult, if not impossible, to imagine how or why someone would choose drinking or using over family. This is why I like the idea of addiction being a mental health issue, where a person gets to a point where he or she would rather continue to self-destruct and lose everything and everyone than stop and get help. I have lost family members to addiction, so I relate to how absolutely baffling drinking to this degree can be, and how heartbreaking.\n\nBut sometimes things get to such a crisis point that a decision has to be made: namely, do we want to go down with the ship or not? It sounds as though you are choosing sanity, being a good mother, and what often becomes the lesser of two evils: saving oneself, setting a life-preserving boundary against alcoholism, versus rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Of course, the ensuing guilt is inevitable, although in truth when a drinking problem reaches such a tragic state, there is little to nothing we can really do anymore and the only real option is to take the lifeboat. By leaving, you are acknowledging the crisis, refusing to minimize it, telling alcoholism you no longer wish to be part of the problem and that you need to protect yourself and your children.\n\nYour husband has long been in a vulnerable situation, and this moment of decision would arrive with or without your presence. The problem is his drinking is killing him, period. Everything else is almost an afterthought. No one can make this decision for him. He must decide whether he wants to stop drinking and live, or keep going and face tragic consequences. Your presence cannot soften these consequences; in fact, your absence may help clarify the starkness of his choice, so I think it’s wise to remove yourself from the situation. No matter how much you have helped him, and with what, the choice remains the same: does he stop or not? This decision and ensuing consequences are out of your control, so in spite of the difficulty you are giving him the dignity of his own choice and allowing him to decide which way he wants to go. You are also setting a good example for everyone by choosing life over insanity and death, though he might not see it that way right now.There is no way, of course, to predict any outcome, though it is my great wish that this is the wake-up call your husband needs; people who drink or use are amazingly adept at ignoring or forgetting inconvenient truths, such as the lethality of drinking and using. Perhaps, as human beings, it is near impossible to consider our own demise. But the demise of the relationship, or at least your presence in the house, might, I truly hope, be a stark reminder of the destructiveness of his alcoholism. You are having a healthy response to an extremely toxic situation (alas). I’m sorry to say you ultimately could not save him even if you stayed.\n\nMy final point is about your own well-being. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of finding your own support. This is an extremely traumatic situation and likely has been for some time, though that might not be obvious to you; a person’s alcohol or drug problem tends to suck all the oxygen out of the room, hog the mental spotlight as it were, so that the partner forgets that he or she also needs help. Often we buy into the myth that says we are not addicted and therefore strong and resilient, such that no help is needed. To want any support or relief might even be seen as selfish: How can I think of myself at a time like this? But as the airline safety tip goes, give yourself oxygen first so you can better assist your loved one. This is, in fact, what you are doing.\n\nJust from the distressed tone of your letter, I can say with reasonable certainty that I think some counseling and/or group support (Al-Anon, community or spiritual/religious groups for families or spouses) would be extremely valuable. It is too easy to underestimate the damage done to our own psyches by addiction; we often don’t feel it until the dust begins to settle. Then, following the guilt comes rage, hurt, anxiety, sadness, and a whole other cluster of intense emotions—not necessarily in that order. This doesn’t at all signify a person’s “failure to cope”; it is, again, a very normal reaction to an abnormally and almost cruelly stressful situation that annihilates love and tenderness, and often hope, to a traumatizing degree. It is a situation, I might add, that often parallels earlier childhood experiences where the nondrinking person became a kind of parentified child, or precocious caregiver, so that this role became second nature, where crushing guilt ensues anytime the person tries to step out of it. But any adult romantic relationship contingent on one-way giving/receiving will sooner or later collapse from imbalance. A thriving, growing love needs mutuality, or at least something in the ballpark. We need to take turns—otherwise the see-saw tips too far in one direction and falls over.\n\nI also often say that a partner going to Al-Anon helps the addicted person too, as it is excellent role modeling.\n\nI’m sorry you are in such a hellacious bind, though I commend you for your courage and stamina in making the sane choice (which can seem insane in the midst of chaos). Your feelings are normal for someone in your position; however, they do not, by any stretch, indicate that you are doing something wrong. It sounds like the kind of wake-up call that has been in the works for some time."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Mother-in-Law Is Taking My Husband Away from Me",
    "Question": "My husband's mother continually butts into our lives. She moved in with us, which was supposed to be a six-month arrangement. That stretched to 14 months, and she has only recently moved to her own apartment. However, she is over at our house every weekend, from Friday night to Sunday night. Also, there are several times during the week when my husband is at her apartment, taking away from our time together. We have had several fights about this, as I feel ignored and he feels stuck. He says he can't say no to her, but he seems to have no problem saying no to me. I feel like he puts her feelings well above mine and my feelings/opinions are of no importance.",
    "TherapistReply": "This is a classic in-law conundrum. Many spouses can feel torn between their responsibilities to their families of origin and the families they are creating. It feels like a no-win situation for everyone involved. The quick—and oversimplified—response is that your husband needs to choose which of those families is his top priority and set appropriate boundaries. In reality, however, the issue tends to be far more complex.\n\nIt sounds as if your husband (and perhaps his mother) believes him to be her sole source of physical and emotional support. Not responding to her needs is quite possibly laden with guilt and fear for your husband. It also sounds as if you have been incredibly accommodating (living with you for 14 months?) but that you are tired of being patient and feeling less important.Fighting about it and competing with his mother for attention will only result in hurt feelings all around and a growing distance between you and your husband. When partners feel forced to choose, some will choose parents over partners; this can do irrevocable damage to relationships. I recommend that you seek out and work with a couples counselor to find ways to support each other as you navigate this dilemma together. Hear him when he says he feels “stuck.” He doesn’t see a viable solution, so working with someone who can offer a broader perspective and help you remain a team is very important.\n\nIt sounds as if your husband might also benefit from working on how to set workable boundaries with his mother without feeling the guilt he’s likely experiencing. Through that process, he will need empathy from you. When you feel (naturally) frustrated, try to imagine your husband stuck in the middle of a tug-of-war between wanting to meet your needs and wanting to meet his mother’s. Then imagine you and your husband pulling together in the same direction. If you both can feel like you are on the same side, I suspect the pressure each of you feels will be reduced tremendously."

    "QuestionTitle": "Why Do I Freeze Up When I Speak in Front of People?",
    "Question": "I used to feel like I had no problem talking in front of people, even large groups of people. That's less so as I get older, though. Is there something wrong with me? It seems to me like it should get easier as you get older. I have to give presentations and pitches as part of my job, and in the last couple of years I have been getting much more nervous, to the point I sometimes get sick beforehand. I have even pretended to be sick in order to not work on a day of a presentation, so that others had to give it in my place. I feel like it's putting my job at risk. There have been a couple of times when I have stood up, thought I was starting to speak, but no words actually came out of my mouth. I couldn't talk. I just froze. I had to ask to step out for a minute. Eventually I powered through those times, but what the heck? Why would this be happening more as I get older? I am 37. In college I was a teacher's assistant and had no problem giving lectures in front of 150 people. Am I developing a medical problem? Please offer some possible explanations, not just suggest I go to therapy. Thank you!",
    "TherapistReply": "Whenever a problem develops where no problem existed before, my first question is always: what is different now? You mention that you previously gave lectures to 150 people as a teacher’s assistant without the anxiety (or, perhaps more to the point, performance anxiety) you are currently dealing with in your professional life. What feels different to you about the two experiences? I wonder if the stakes seem higher now, the content more complex, or the audience more inquisitive or demanding. It seems reasonable that any of these possibilities, or something else along these lines, could create and/or intensify anxiety around public speaking.\n\nIf you can figure out what has developed to cause the problem, perhaps you can figure out some strategies for addressing it. For example, if upon reflecting on the differences between your experience as a TA and as a professional you discover that the content is more complex and the audience more inquisitive, it might be helpful to take some trainings or courses to deepen your knowledge of the content area. This might increase your confidence in your ability to answer questions as they come up. Maybe reflection will lead you to discover that your anxiety is less about content and more about style. Perhaps you have realized that the level of polish expected of professionals, as opposed to student TAs, is quite different and you don’t feel like you measure up. If this is the case, participating in a group like Toastmasters might be helpful in mastering and developing confidence in your public speaking skills.You also raise the possibility that there is a medical problem that has developed and is to blame for this. The only way to rule that out for sure is to schedule an appointment with your doctor for an exam and discussion about this, and I recommend that you do that sooner rather than later. I am not a doctor, so as much as I hear your desire for explanations, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate as to potential medical issues you might be experiencing.\n\nIt is also possible that the problem is neither medical nor a reflection of simple insecurities about speaking in public. How do you feel about your career and where you are professionally? Sometimes, unexplained anxiety that seems to come up out of the blue can be a way of getting your attention and forcing you to address dissatisfaction with an area of your life that you are not fully aware of. If the above recommendations don’t yield any solutions and you land on a vague dissatisfaction with your career, what might be helpful is partnering with a career counselor to explore where you are, where you want to be, and developing a realistic plan for how to get there."

    "QuestionTitle": "It Was Only Flirting, but Now My Husband Doesn’t Trust Me",
    "Question": "My husband and I have been married for some time now, and he has had trust issues from the start. It was never anything I did, but I think he was so hurt in his previous relationship that he has a hard time trusting women. Well, recently a new coworker has been showing me attention and saying nice things to me. I, of course, am flattered and like the attention. We did flirt a little, but I never had any intention to start anything, and neither did he; he never even implied it. One day I was sending texts to a friend about the guy at work, venting, and I didn't remember that my texts are linked to my iPad. My husband read them and went into a rage. Rightfully so, he was upset. I understand what I did was wrong. He had every right to be angry, and I didn't try to take that from him. I apologized over and over again, begging for his forgiveness. Two weeks have passed now, and he still treats me as if I had an affair and basically makes me feel like I should have a scarlet letter branded into me. I do love my husband very much, and I never wanted to hurt him. I have tried to make it up to him, and just when I think we are moving forward, he takes two steps back and we are arguing all over again. What can I do to gain his trust back and believe me when I say nothing was going on and nothing was going to happen?",
    "TherapistReply": "With the intensity of the feelings you and your husband are experiencing, I imagine two weeks feels like a long time. In reality, and especially considering your husband’s preexisting trust issues, two weeks is a small blip on the radar. My sense is that it is going to take quite a bit more time and work to come back from this.\n\nBecause it has only been a couple of weeks—and it does sound like there has been some progress made—it seems possible that you two might be able to work this through on your own. However, because trust has always been somewhat of an issue for your husband, it might be valuable to consider partnering with a couples therapist. Couples therapists are trained and experienced in working through issues very similar to the one you and your husband are experiencing.\n\nTrust is not a static quality in relationships; it ebbs and flows throughout the course of a relationship based on personal insecurities, jealousy, life changes, actions that breach trust, and many other things. When the trust levels in a relationship are low, it is important for couples to acknowledge this and work on it. While fluctuations in trust are normal, unaddressed trust issues are a recipe for disaster.It sounds like you are acknowledging the validity of your husband’s feelings and accepting your role in the situation. This, along with patience and a willingness to continue to work on healing—again, ideally with a therapist—is really all you can do. Hopefully, your husband will also be willing to commit to the process of healing from this experience, as well as a deeper exploration of the trust issues he seems to have brought into your marriage. Getting to the root of his trust issues is an important part of your path forward together, and until you do that, continuing to have compassion for your husband and the pain of his past betrayal is important.\n\nIt sounds like recovering from this is going to be a longer and more painful process than you were expecting. While I can’t make any guarantees about outcomes, this could end up leading you and your husband to much deeper trust and greater intimacy."

    "QuestionTitle": "What If My Racist Family Rejects My Girlfriend and Her Kids?",
    "Question": "For the past six months, I have been seeing a woman who has four kids (11, 12, 14, 16). I am 24, my girlfriend is 40. The age difference isn't so much the issue as the fact that all of her kids are multiracial (my girlfriend is white; the kids' father is black). I am white. Before you call me a bigot, please understand that I have no problem whatsoever with her kids. In fact, I love her kids. They're great kids! In fact, I'd be very open to adopting them legally if our relationship progresses to the point where we'd want to consider marriage. The problem is with my family. I'm supposed to go to a family reunion this summer in Alabama—rural Alabama. Most of my family members who are expected to attend are not very open-minded, shall we say, about mixed couples or mixed families. I grew up hearing a litany of racist and snide remarks about people of color. I hate to say that about my family, but those are the values that were instilled in them and even though society has come a long way, there are parts of the country that are very slow to change (or unwilling to). I want to bring my girlfriend and her kids with me to the reunion, but I am very worried that they'll be met with cold stares, unfriendliness, rejection, maybe even hatefulness. I am quite sure also that some will whisper and wisecrack about me. I can take that, although it would make me uncomfortable and I'd probably end up making a scene. I am more worried about my girlfriend and her kids. I don't want the way my family might treat her to impact her impression of me. I don't want to scare her off, basically. I just don't see it going well. I can bring her and the kids and hope for the best, I can just take her but not the kids (maybe), I could go alone, or I could not go at all. None of these options feels good, but the first one feels both right and riskiest. I am wondering what you think. Thank you.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for reaching out with such a powerful and important question. I commend you for taking the time and being thoughtful, considerate, and deliberate in planning your course of action with what could be a highly sensitive situation.\n\nMy first thought about this is whether you’ve spoken to your girlfriend about your concerns. Does she know about your family’s tendencies? She may have similar feelings or worries, and together the two of you can discuss the various options and come to a decision that best suits everyone. I’m quite confident that she has been dealing with various forms of racism for quite some time, as she was in an interracial relationship and now has biracial children. Given that, she may have her own perspectives on how to deal with situations like this in a way that is supportive to her and the children. If you haven’t yet spoken with her about this, I would suggest you start there. Not only will having that discussion clear things up for you and help you clarify your course of action, it will help build your relationship by fostering open and caring communication.Should you both decide to attend the family reunion, you may indeed be faced with the challenges you are concerned about. As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense. I suggest you openly discuss this with the whole family, talk about your concerns, and plan a strategy. Discuss the fact racism still exists, it’s still a problem for minorities, and it can be incredibly hurtful to be on the receiving end.\n\nIf your family makes racist comments, you can choose how to handle it. You can decide as a family if you are going to address the comments calmly and rationally, or if you will decide to remove yourself from the situation. You can plan a response such as, “I will not allow my family to be subjected to this sort of racist behavior. If you want us to stay, you will apologize and refrain from further comments of that nature.” The other option is to choose to leave immediately.\n\nWhat is NOT a good option is to lose control, get angry, and make a scene. As difficult as it may be to remain calm in those types of circumstances, nothing is ever resolved by acting in anger. If you are concerned that you can’t handle this sort of situation without getting angry and making a scene, I suggest you not be in it at all.\n\nIt sounds as though this relationship has the potential to be long-term, as you seem committed to her and the children. If that is the situation, you will be faced with a lot of racism, microaggressions, and other painful situations for as long as racism continues to be an issue in our world. Sadly, there is a long way to go on that front. You are in a unique position to act as an ally for your girlfriend’s children, and in some ways, for all people of color.\n\nIf you and your girlfriend decide to go to your reunion and face what can possibly arise, you are opening yourselves up to be uncomfortable, hurt, and upset. On the other hand, you may be opening up opportunities for dialogue, reflection, and maybe even change in your family. This is not an easy situation, and it will require much of you and your girlfriend to navigate it with grace, but I believe that with honesty, openness, and a willingness to engage, you can manage it. I hope you believe that, too."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! A Decade Later, I Just Found Out My Husband Has 2 Kids",
    "Question": "I have been married for seven years and have three children with my husband. We have had our ups and downs, like most couples. When we first got together nine years ago, he told me he didn't have kids. I would have been fine with it if he did, it wouldn't have changed how I felt about him, but he was very clear about not having them. Well, guess what? I came to find out last month he has two kids with two women from previous relationships. They are ages 11 and 12. He pays child support for them from an account I don't have access to. He told me he was moving money from our shared account into a retirement account for us, but instead he's been moving it into this secret child support account. I don't understand! I am livid! When I confronted him, he was humiliated and begged for forgiveness. He said he didn't think I'd want to be with him if I knew he had kids (even though that's not true), and since he is not in their lives at all (he has no contact), he says that \"in a sense\" he doesn't have kids. That's ridiculous. How could he hide something like this from me for so long? What else is he hiding? I love this man, but seriously, this is wrong and I don't know if I can handle it. I am actually thinking about ending our marriage, which makes me sad for OUR kids. What do you think about all this? Am I wrong to be this upset?",
    "TherapistReply": "What an incredible breach of trust. Not only did he lie to you about not having kids, which I’m sure made sense to him at the time, but he perpetuated the lie by actively hiding an account from you and keeping important financial information from you. Of course you are having concerns and wondering if you can trust him.\n\nOften people lie for one of two reasons—from fear and a desire to avoid negative consequences, or to gain something they don’t believe they can gain via the truth. Your husband says he lied initially because he didn’t think you would accept him if you knew the truth. Lying can become a habit and even a coping mechanism. Lying can generate fear of being found out, which necessitates additional lies until it looks as if there is no way out. It seems as if your husband justified continuing to lie for fear that if you learned the truth his world would unravel. I am not condoning his actions, but I can see how one lie begets another and another until it seems insurmountable.Now that the truth is out, this would be a great time to work with your husband on becoming completely honest with you about everything. That means giving you access to all of his financial records, legal documents, and passwords as well as sharing his entire unvarnished history with you. Whether or not you intend to stay in your marriage, if you are going to parent with him, rebuilding trust is going to be important for you and for your kids. I recommend working with a therapist on this process. If your husband has indeed been hiding even more, being able to tell you about it in a safe, neutral environment may encourage more transparency. It may also encourage him to consider why he chose dishonesty for so long.\n\nI should mention that, while uncommon, there are some individuals who lie without remorse, who use dishonesty to manipulate, or who lie simply because they can. It is a very small percentage of the population, and I am not suggesting that your husband falls into that category, but it might be helpful to have professional support as well to ensure that you are not dealing with this particular type of individual."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Husband Is Putting His Hobby Before Our Marriage",
    "Question": "I've been married for one year. My husband has to travel for work. He leaves Monday morning and comes home on Thursday night. I work Monday to Friday. The only time we can spend together is Saturday and Sunday. He has past failed relationships, which he says failed because both his exes cheated on him. I have never had any relationship before. When we first started meeting, I knew about his budding hobby of photography, however I never realized how crazily obsessed he was with it. I married him because I genuinely fell in love with him. However, he tells me now that he married me because he found me a kind-hearted girl and I supported his photography. We have a very troublesome marriage, as we do not get to spend much time together. And more importantly, he thinks there is nothing wrong with that. He said that's what he thought our marriage would be like. I had expected that as a newly married couple we would spend more time together and do things as a couple to bond, however I later realized that he only wants to spend time together (most of the time) if we are doing anything related to photography. Even our honeymoon trip was completely changed into a photography trip. He gets upset if we miss a sunset or a sunrise photo, but is OK with the fact that—because of his obsession—we are missing out on OUR time, our memories together. If I say this, he says I am against his photography. Now he only wants to shoot night photos. He plans trips for himself once a month which are about being out in the night in national parks with no lights, rattlesnakes, and whatnot. He does not include me. But if he is taking pictures at night, obviously he has to sleep during the day, so that doesn't work out. I have started feeling so alone from the past few months that he bothers me. It affects my mood, I am not happy anymore. I feel my husband does not love me, but rather married me because I was a good fit for his lifestyle. Now he is trying to tell me that he will go out one weekend to take pictures by himself, then spend three weekends with me and work from home for one week a month to compensate for that one weekend he goes out alone. I can't wrap my head around this \"I will fit you in my empty spaces in my life\" kind of attitude that he is giving me. He says photography will always be his priority and if this doesn't work well with me, I can leave. It hurts me even more that I am the only one who is affected by our issues. He is prepared to let me go, but not his obsession. I am not sure what to do.",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like you are feeling very alone in your marriage. Understandably, that is causing you great pain. I imagine your husband’s rather disinterested, even cold, response to your concerns causes you to feel unloved and like you are just not a priority for him.\n\nIs he willing to consider engaging in couples therapy? Are you? It seems like it could be very helpful given how far apart you two are on this issue. You are so deeply hurt and unable to get your needs met, and he seems both totally unfazed by your expressions of pain and largely unwilling to make any changes. I wonder if couples therapy could help the two of you to hear each other a bit better. If empathy and compassion can fill the space between you, you might find some middle ground.I also wonder if middle ground isn’t closer than it seems. It sounds like he is willing to compromise to some degree in that he is planning to work from home one week each month since he is also planning to take one weekend a month to go on photography trips. This may indicate that he has heard you to some degree and is willing to make a change to address your concerns.\n\nCouples therapy might also provide an opportunity to bring some of your individual issues to light. I wonder what it is like for your husband to have had both of his previous relationships end due to infidelity. Does this cause him to keep you at a distance so he doesn’t get close enough to get hurt?\n\nYou indicate that this is your first relationship. It sounds like you had a lot of expectations about what marriage would be like and those expectations are not being met. An exploration of these unmet expectations might produce some valuable insights for you.\n\nI hope you will both consider seeking out couples therapy to try to bring the relationship to a place that works for both of you. Even if he is unwilling, you might find your own individual therapy to be helpful in sorting out your feelings and determining your course of action."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Lost in My Mind, with No Sense of Life Purpose",
    "Question": "I’m 28 years old and these days I feel like I’m floating in the middle of the ocean with nothing to grasp onto and no shoreline in sight. I’m just treading water trying to stay alive. I’m fortunate enough to be born into a situation where I have a supportive family, I was able to graduate college with an engineering degree, and I have a good job with benefits. On the surface my life looks great, but I feel a sense of hopelessness when I think about my life’s purpose. I know I’m privileged in comparison to most of the people in this world, but it’s mostly material privilege. How can I have so much of my life figured out and still feel as if there is just no point to any of it? Is this all there is to my life? Do I have another 40 years or so of paying bills and then a cold hole in the ground to look forward to? I know in my mind that I should be thankful for all I have at my age, but I just can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’m wasting it all as a worker bee. I’ll put a smile on my face, brush my teeth in the morning, and continue going to work, but what can I do to shake this feeling of no direction, no purpose, and no real human experience? Please help.",
    "TherapistReply": "I don’t suppose it’s much consolation, but you describe your situation very well—lost in your mind, indeed. You seem very much in your head, sort of like having an “out of body” experience of sorts. So the antidote might be to get out of your mind, if you will. I say that with a smile because I think if you get out of your mind and into the rest of yourself—body and soul, for example—you may feel less lost.\n\nHow to begin?\n\nFirst, I’d pursue a therapeutic relationship with someone who will help you lose your mind and find yourself. Does that sound trite? Maybe, but the truth is often so simple that people overlook it. Based solely on what you have written, you sound as if you might be depressed. There are a number of ways to deal with depression, including, depending on the individual, psychotherapy (talk therapy is helpful), medication (in concert with therapy), body therapy (yoga therapy or some somatic therapy or mindfulness activity that you find to your taste), and participation in doings that have nothing to do with work. Such doings may include, say, yoga or art or sports or music or, maybe best of all, a volunteer activity that will exercise your compassion.You write that you are privileged and have no purpose. Find one. Maybe you could tutor, garden, or help out at the animal shelter. I don’t know what kinds of things appeal to you, but find something you like that will enable you to contribute to our world and then do it. Having had the privilege of a good education, you have much to offer your community and the world.\n\nYou write that you “put a smile on” and go on. I applaud your “going on-ness” and it’s a good start, but remember what Henry David Thoreau wrote long ago: “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.” I hope you pursue and find your song and sing it. Sing several. Sing a cantata.\n\nYou say you have “no real human experience.” I’m not sure what you mean by that, but if there is some particular experience you are lacking, then this would be a topic to discuss with a therapist. What is it? Can it be achieved? How can you go about doing it? Perhaps your life’s purpose is to discover what is meaningful to you and then to manifest your meaning by helping others find what is useful and meaningful to them.\n\nMaybe when you write “human experience,” you mean experiencing your feelings. If that’s so, I invite you to awaken your emotional life through action.\n\nChanging the way you approach the world may change it. I wish you the best!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! If I Have an Abortion, Do I Have to Tell My Boyfriend?",
    "Question": "Hi, please help me. I have been with my boyfriend for a little less than six months. We live separately in upstate New York. I am not happy with him, and I just found out I am pregnant. We use protection, so this came as a shock. I have not told him. He is a nice guy but he's not the one for me, and I don't want to have his child for sure. He couldn't even really help support it if I did want to have it. I guess my question is whether it's OK for me to decide to terminate my pregnancy and not tell him. Am I within my legal right to do that? Should it matter? It's my body and my future I have to think about. I am not ready to be a mother. The last thing I want is for him to tell me he wants me to have the child and try to stop me from doing what I think is best. Please tell me I'm not a bad person.",
    "TherapistReply": "Despite using protection, you have gotten pregnant; naturally, you are shocked. You are not happy with your boyfriend, he is not a person you want to parent with, and you’re wondering if you even want (or have) to tell him that you are pregnant in the first place. You seem to indicate that your relationship doesn’t promise the stability—emotional and financial—that a child needs and deserves. You are worried but very clear-headed and caring in your analysis of the issues involved in your pregnancy.\n\nYou ask whether you are within your rights to terminate your pregnancy and not tell your boyfriend. As you might know, abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973, when the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that women have the right to abort prior to the viability of the fetus. I am not an attorney and nothing I write in this space should be construed as legal advice, but as far as I can tell the Roe v. Wade ruling doesn’t spell out paternal rights, and a little online research suggests that there are no barriers to you making this decision on your own, without your boyfriend’s consent or awareness (Planned Parenthood v. Danforth in 1976 addressed consent, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 addressed awareness). Again, do not take anything I’ve written here as gospel. Your question is one that an attorney can and should answer definitively, possibly even over the phone. Please call one. You might also refer to Planned Parenthood, which would either be able to answer your questions or point you to resources that can.You do not indicate your age, nor do you ask whether your parents need to know, but for the record, according to Planned Parenthood’s website, there is no parental involvement requirement in New York for persons under 18. (Some states may require one or both parents to consent to an abortion or be informed of it, a requirement that can be waived by a judge.)\n\nBeyond the legalities, you ask “should it matter” whether your boyfriend knows about your desire to have an abortion. That’s a difficult question that only you can answer. The fact you’re grappling with the ethics of it all is a sign, to me, that you are proceeding carefully and thoughtfully.\n\nIt seems to me that one of the questions you might be asking yourself is what it means to be a woman in the United States in 2015. There’s a book called Our Bodies, Ourselves, first published in 1973 and updated every few years—the latest edition was released in 2011. You might take a look at it and see if it helps you find peace. The book supports women taking ownership of their bodies, which seems to be one of the many issues you are struggling with.\n\nYou ask for reassurance that you are not a “bad person.” You don’t seem like a bad person to me. You seem like a worried and scared young woman who is in a bad spot and trying to figure out the best way out of it. I think you would benefit greatly from speaking to a counselor or therapist who can help guide you through some of the more challenging internal quandaries you face. You write, correctly, that it’s your body and your future that you have to consider when making important life-changing decisions. I salute your warm, level-headed, and thoughtful approach to finding your way."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Love My Wife, but I Don’t Like Having Sex with Her",
    "Question": "Please help me save my marriage. I have been married for three years to an amazing woman. The problem is that I don't like having sex with her. She has a high sex drive, but I'm just not attracted to her sexually the way I have been with previous girlfriends. I don't know why, but physically she's not really my type, and what she likes isn't really what I like. I'm in love with her personality, with the woman she is as a whole. I feel bad when I pretend to be too tired for sex or not feeling well, but I feel even worse when I go through the motions for her sole benefit. I put on a good show, when I put on a show at all. I've even faked orgasms. How many men do that? Anyway, the point is I really love my wife and I don't ever want to leave her—but neither of us is really happy with what's going on (or not going on) in the bedroom, and I know that's an important part of a good and stable marriage, especially in your thirties. What can I do?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your very honest question. This is, obviously, a sensitive topic. But you might take heart in the fact it is not all that uncommon an issue among couples.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like you have great respect for your wife but something is getting in the way of your enjoying physical intimacy. It also sounds like you struggle with the “double whammy” of feeling bad about your feelings about sex. In other words, you have a difficulty and then bad feelings about the difficulty. Try to give yourself a break with the latter, at least. It doesn’t sound as though you are intending to be unkind or selfish. It does sound as though there is some unconscious obstacle to enjoying closeness with your wife, whom you obviously love very much.\n\nYou say she isn’t your “type” physically but also mention that with regard to sexual preferences, what she likes differs from what you like. The specifics don’t matter for our purposes here. What matters is that whatever she’s into isn’t your cup of tea. Again, this frequently happens with married couples, who discover a difference in sexual preferences or desires (or level of intensity, etc.) and then feel stuck in how to reconcile these differences, which may have very different meanings to each partner. What is edgy or exciting to one may be frightening or alienating to the other, and so on.\n\nThe first question that crossed my mind has to do with the timing of discovering that she isn’t your type, even though you obviously love her and want to be with her. Were you aware of this before marriage? Let’s say for the sake of argument you were. This to me could mean that (1) there are other qualities about her that drew you to her and made up what is lacking sexually, and/or (2) the sexual attractiveness factor was separated or minimized in your decision to marry.\n\nI’d be curious about the underlying motivations here. The overall tone of your question suggests that perhaps your biggest struggle is with (I’m guessing) guilt or shame you feel about disappointing her sexually, rather than your own shortage of satisfaction. She seems to initiate sex, is how I interpret this, whereas you’d be happy just letting it go.Is it possible that, as with many young men, sex was too important in earlier relationships, so that you consciously decided to put sexual attractiveness or compatibility on the backburner with this relationship? That too much emphasis on sex (or something else about you) might turn her off? Do you compensate in the marriage with use of pornography or other self-satisfying methods? (If so, what would happen if you took a break? Would sex with your wife become more viable or enticing?) Did or do you struggle with sexual insecurities, as many people do (but are reluctant to talk about), which makes sexuality difficult or anxiety-provoking, even emotionally dangerous?\n\nIf I were your therapist, I’d be curious to empathically explore whether sexual compatibility was an issue before marriage, and what your motivations were to look for other factors in moving forward with marriage. I’d be even more curious to understand what sex means to you today. Was there guilt, possibly, over making sex a priority earlier on, or guilt or shame now about sexual enjoyment? Sometimes men are so intent on being respectful to women that they make their own desires and wants much less important, for fear of being a “pig” (which usually means they aren’t one). They may be ashamed of their sexual interests. Or they have developed a habit with porn (this may not apply to you) that they are ashamed of. Again, you are the one faking orgasm—so that, I surmise, your wife will not be disappointed or unhappy.\n\nI wonder, in other words, about your sexual pleasure and happiness, which from what I gather is not as important as the other factors that make you crazy about your gal. If so, why? Perhaps your pleasure would also make her happy. Does she understand that her preferences, the things she likes to do in bed that you don’t, just are not doing it for you? It might be helpful to examine what it is you don’t like about these preferences. Is it that she is initiating them? Is there something emotionally or symbolically uncomfortable about it? Is sex too emotionally risky because one gets “naked” in a variety of ways (not just literally)? One simplistic example: A man with an overly controlling mother might be fearful of allowing a woman to lead the sexual dance too often, or forcefully, even if to her it doesn’t seem all that frequent or forceful; these are the types of differences that have to be gently and sensitively co-examined and mutually understood.\n\nEach of us makes specific meanings of sex; for some, it may be a chance to express feelings and passions that can’t be said verbally, outside the bedroom. Some like darker or rougher sex, a way of expressing parts of themselves they feel can’t be “let out” otherwise (for various reasons). Some assertive people like to be more submissive (or remain assertive) in bed, and vice versa. Our choices come in so many different shapes and colors, choices that can mean very different things to a partner. What is enticing to some may be threatening to others, which can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings if not looked at in an empathic way.\n\nTo my mind, the most important thing is finding a way to communicate some of this—after your own self-examination and reflection, probably—with your wife, to avoid build-up of resentment, anxiety, or other emotional distancing. I might also take a look to see if there are other habits or methods of self-care that create distance between you and her. You might even want to seek out a couples counselor to help with this; even a few sessions can be helpful in assisting the communication and compromises necessary in this area, as with so many others.\n\nIt sounds like you care about your wife very much, which I found touching. I can only imagine she will be equally touched by your sincere effort to maintain or even build upon your connection with her, as she obviously means a great deal to you. And just because we have a problem doesn’t mean we are a problem."

    "QuestionTitle": "She’s Everything I Want in a Woman—Except She’s Religious",
    "Question": "I am an atheist and, in my early adult years, came to strongly detest the forces of religious influence on society and the world. I could never see myself going to church, and it's hard for me not to think about people who do as anything other than brainwashed. Have I met some nice, smart, religious people? Of course I have. In fact, that's the root of my question. About four months ago I met a woman who is everything I want in a partner—funny, kind, generous, good with kids, smart, sexy, accomplished, and fun. The problem, as I see it, is that she is deeply religious, to the point that she not only goes to church every week and volunteers at every opportunity, but also constantly talks about God and how her relationship with Jesus is the most important thing in her life. As strange or insensitive as this might sound, I don't want to come second to Jesus (or any other invisible man) in my partner's life. She knows I'm not religious, but I've spared her my harsher assessments of religion, as I don't want to offend her. But it's all too much for me. Everything is great with this woman until she starts talking about her faith. She has asked me to go to church with her, just to experience it with her, and I've made up an excuse not to go each time. I really have strong feelings for this woman, but I don't know if I can handle this. I'm sure the obvious answer here is \"Well then move on,\" but matters of the heart aren't always that simple. I really care about her. I want this to work. I just don't know if it can.",
    "TherapistReply": "Can relationships between people who share very different faiths work? Absolutely—but only if they also share a profound respect for one another and their respective beliefs. Does your girlfriend expect her partner (and perhaps future husband) to have an active shared religious life with her? If so, and if you are certain that this path is not for you, that is a conversation better to be had sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you are open to sharing her experiences, that’s another story. It is also possible to share experiences without necessarily sharing the same beliefs. There are many people who accompany their partners to services that may not reflect their own personal spirituality or beliefs. As long as the expectations you have of one another are clear and accepted by both of you, faith differences do not have to be a deal-breaker.What is most important is that the two of you have some open and honest conversations about your personal beliefs and the vision you each have for your future. Right now it’s just the two of you negotiating your relationship, but what might happen if you were to eventually start a family together? I imagine she might want her children to share in her faith and her experiences. Is that something you can see yourself accepting and supporting?\n\nThere are many families that make it work despite mixing very different religious views. Only the two of you can decide if that path will work for you. These are important conversations to have now and not months or years down the line. If you need help having these conversations, you may want to consult a couples counselor who has experience in issues related to faith-based differences."

    "QuestionTitle": "I’ve Stolen, I’ve Lied, and I Want My Wife Back. Help!",
    "Question": "I have been married for 11 years and with my wife for 13. We have two children together. I have been horrible to my wife. I have lied about pretty much everything. I have stolen money and rings from family members and sold them for money so I can buy alcohol. I even pawned my wedding ring to get money. I used to look at porn. In January, after being confronted by my wife, I told her everything. However, after being pressed for more truths, for some reason I told my wife that I cheated on her nine years ago. She then kicked me out. The bad thing is I really didn't. Now, obviously and understandably, she doesn't believe that I didn't. I have since seen a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and alcoholism. I go to AA meetings, take anxiety medicine, and see my pastor two times a week to talk. I really love her and want her back. She won't even talk to me yet. All she says is \"admit to the affair and we'll work things out.\" I told her I can't lie anymore. Last weekend, we ended up sleeping together and having amazing sex. Then the next morning, she told me to leave again. Now she is back to asking me to admit I cheated on her. I have also started running, which my wife says is stupid and I should work on my marriage, not myself. I just started seeing a counselor this week. However, she won't go. Any ideas what to do? Thanks!",
    "TherapistReply": "You write that you have lied, stolen, and pawned jewelry from family, and used that money to buy alcohol. You were seemingly out of control, but you weren’t really—you made choices, choices that had devastating consequences. Instead of showing your wife your best self, you showed her your worst. The only thing you didn’t do is cheat on her, although you lied about that, too, and told her that in fact you had been adulterous. The appearance of cheating was the last straw for your wife and finally broke your marriage. Did you know that might happen? How did you want and expect her to react? Why did you say you did something you didn’t do?\n\nThese are important questions that probably have complicated answers. A good therapist can help you unravel the mysteries of why you did what you did. That deeper exploration and understanding of yourself is key to keeping such behavior from happening again. In your letter, at least, you seem to be taking some ownership of your actions, and that’s a good first step toward healing. It’s far from the only step you’ll need to take toward preserving your marriage, however.\n\nYou have been together for 13 years and have two children, so there’s clearly a loving foundation somewhere underneath all the noise; you say you “really love” your wife and “want her back.” You have just begun seeing a counselor (good idea) and have started running (another good idea), but your wife says you should work on the marriage, not on yourself. She’s partly right and she’s partly wrong. Working on yourself is part of working on your marriage, but another part would be to earn back her trust, which—if it comes to pass—will take time and a lot of effort on your part.Part of that process is showing her your best self, and not just for a day or two at a time. I think seeing your pastor twice a week, seeing a psychiatrist, going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, being in therapy, and taking medication to help with your anxiety are steps to revealing the good parts of who you are, both to yourself and to your wife. Don’t underestimate what you’re doing; you are moving in the right direction, no matter what direction your wife is going.\n\nYou write that you and your wife had “amazing sex” before she kicked you out again. Don’t overestimate what that means. Maybe that’s a sign that the fire between you two isn’t out, but it could also be a sign that you both missed the intimate connection you had, were in the right mood, and made the most of the moment. Good sex can be a part of a good marriage, but a good marriage is mostly about the less sexy moments between those moments.\n\nYou describe yourself, your mistakes, and your perceived faults, but you say little about your wife. I wonder what she is like. It takes two to make a good marriage, just as it takes two to fight and make a troubled relationship. I’m sorry that so far she has resisted going to counseling with you, and I hope that in the future she changes her mind. Marriage is a joint effort, and I hope you can convince her of that while continuing to work on yourself and work toward being more worthy of her trust. Seeing a marriage counselor together would help you both deal with the strong feelings of fear, anger, and resentment that are characterizing your relationship, particularly from her vantage point. Even if she won’t go, though, I hope you continue to do so, as therapy will help give you the tools to be a more responsible father, partner, and person."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Husband Won’t Let Me Discipline His Children",
    "Question": "In December I married a man who has four children. I am unable to have children of my own. My problem, which I hope you can provide some advice on, is that my husband will not allow me to discipline the children, who I now view as our children but he seems to think otherwise. I know I haven't had the benefit of being in their lives since the day they were born but if I'm going to be a mother to these kids, I have to be able to give love as well as guidance and discipline where appropriate, right? The kids are 6, 7, 9, and 11 years old. When I talk about discipline I just mean things like grounding them for a week, or taking away their phone privileges for a day, or asking them to do chores (which they are supposed to be doing anyway), or admonishing them for cursing, or saying they have to do their homework before they play games. Things like that. It is OK for my husband to do these things but he gets mad at me when I do them. He says they view him as the authority figure and he knows them best and he doesn't want them to have a negative view of me. I think discipline is just part of raising kids and I'm not just here to be a housewife. I want to be a mom too. Can you help?",
    "TherapistReply": "You have put your finger on one of the biggest challenges in blended families—the role of stepparents in discipline. There is no single right answer for this question; every family and family situation is unique. You are also a newly blended family and will experience growing pains as you all, kids included, adjust to this major change.\n\nThis may be hard to hear, but marrying your husband does not automatically make you “mom” to his kids. I hear your desire to parent, and I am sure you have so much love and guidance to offer them. If, however, you and your husband are not on the same page about your role, there is no way the kids will follow your lead. Your attempts to parent them without the support of your husband will only lead to confusion and tension and very likely resentment. You can still be a loving, responsible adult in their lives without having to be their parent.I often recommend to couples who are blending families that they discuss expectations and roles prior to making any major changes. It is not too late, however to have these conversations. I highly recommend that you and your husband enlist the help of a therapist who works with blended families to talk through your concerns. Your husband may have some specific reasons he wants you to stay out of the discipline realm.\n\nYou mention he doesn’t want the kids to have a negative view of you. Perhaps he is nervous that if you take on the role of disciplinarian, it will negatively impact their acceptance of you into the family or create conflict he isn’t ready to handle. One of the greatest challenges in blended families is a parent feeling like he or she has to choose between the new spouse and the kids. Your husband might be trying to avoid that dynamic by keeping your relationship with the kids strictly positive. You may or may not agree with those reasons, but talking about them is the first step, and a trained therapist can help nurture and guide that conversation.\n\nIt is important for your role in the family to be clear to everyone. You are entitled to respect as a member of the family. With four children approaching the tween and teen years, you can expect many challenges to authority—yours and your husband’s. It is critical that you act as a team with shared understanding and purpose. What that understanding is will depend very much on what works for all of you."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Husband Cheated! So Why Is Our Sex Life Hotter Than Ever?",
    "Question": "He cheated, and now it seems our relationship is stronger than ever. We've been together for almost 13 years. I was the other woman when we first met. He left her for me. Sex was great in the beginning. We were VERY ADVENTUROUS. We would invite other couples into our bed, role play, BDSM, etc. It was intense, fun, and THRILLING! We fell madly, deeply in love. I had two kids from a previous relationship and so did he. We all came together, Brady Bunch style. It was challenging at first, of course. But now these kids are inseparable! I became focused on the kids, work, finances, life. It seemed, to me at least, that he didn't share the same passion I had for the kids. He would get frustrated easily with disciplining our kids and it often turned into an argument between the two of us. I was so angry with him. So unimpressed. Disappointed. Sex began taking a backseat until I had absolutely no interest in pleasing him anymore. In any form. I began rejecting his advances. It went on for so long that I forgot how to love him. Even when things were good, because you know they weren't always bad times, I still couldn't respond to him. As if I were afraid to touch him. Why? I have no clue why it got so bad. I barely had interest in sex at all. I couldn't even masturbate. No sex drive to speak of. But everything else was fine. He was my best friend. He gave me anything I could want. We were happy, right? Just ... no sex. This went on for about two years. He recently confessed to having just ended an affair. A year-long affair. A YEAR! My whole world fell apart. My safe, little bubble of ignorant bliss had burst! I couldn't believe that this could happen to me. Someone else, sure. NOT ME. But there I was, crying, screaming, hitting and smacking and cursing him to hell. He was crying, too. Apologizing. Begging for my forgiveness. And then the craziest, twisted thing happened: I WANTED MY HUSBAND. Passionately, desperately, painfully, hatefully—I was so confused! It was a tidal wave of tension relieving, intense, violent, AMAZING SEX! It's been about a week since the confession, and we haven't stopped. We're like teenagers. All the deep, intense passion we had when we first met has been reborn, and we're having an outrageous time! But in my alone moments, I can't help but wonder why this happened to me. Why did my husband's infidelity awaken my sexual desires for him? And these thoughts lead me to fear the worst: will this die again? Is he still seeing her? What happens when the kids leave us? Will we still want to be together? I'm very happy to have this new relationship with the man I love, but I can't help doubting myself, my actions, my feelings, whether or not I should be trusting that this is worth another chance.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your letter. Let me start by saying this pattern is more common than many people realize. There are varying opinions on why feelings and reactions evolve this way, but there are a couple of things that may be playing into it. First, the revelation of an affair is indication that your marriage is on shaky ground, and your increased desire for sex may be one way of “staking your claim,” consciously or unconsciously, and regaining the ground you feel you have lost. You may—again, not necessarily consciously—desire increased intimacy with your husband because you are afraid to lose him.\n\nSecond, there are many people who, for various reasons, associate love with extreme emotions. When those individuals get into relationships that are relatively “easy” and “normal,” they can and sometimes do lose passion for their partners. When something happens to heighten emotions, it can serve as a spark of sorts and passion can, as a result, be reignited. Based on what you described about the trajectory of your relationship, it sounds like you might be inclined—again, possibly unconsciously—to equate intensity with love. While maintaining passion is important for a relationship, it is also not reasonable to maintain high levels of intensity long-term. In the course of everyday life, over time, intensity may diminish and passion may wane. Part of the challenge every couple faces is how to have a strong, passionate union when life’s many demands creep in.During this confusing time, despite the intense feelings you’re having, you are asking yourself some valid and serious questions that deserve to be carefully examined before you make any rash decisions. While it is well within the realm of “ordinary” to have your passion reignited in a situation like yours, it is worth deeper examination to understand why you responded this way and if you want to continue this pattern. The other questions you are asking are also important to sit with; the trust in your relationship was breached, and that takes significant time and effort to repair. Are you both willing and able to do that? If you do choose to stay together and work things out, how will you deal with the dynamics at play and work to maintain passion without crisis? Another question that bears examination is if your relationship style is best suited for monogamy; it sounds like you both once enjoyed a more open or “swinging” style that inspired passionate feelings reminiscent of what you’re feeling now.\n\nYour husband made his choices and surely had his reasons, and exploring his experience of this as well as yours in a safe, nonjudgmental, therapeutic space likely would serve him, you, your relationship, and ultimately your family. Your situation is complex, but there are many therapists who specialize in sexuality and relationship concerns. I strongly suggest you seek out a skilled therapist who can assist you in navigating your path, whatever you decide. Best wishes along the way."

    "Question": "I'm having a tough time bringing up the important stuff during counseling sessions! I'm a college freshman and I've been seeing a school counselor since September of the fall semester. I had a lot of problems in high school, namely depression and self-injury. These did not go away once I came to college and I came to really yearn for help, so I sought it. I'm very thankful for the opportunity to have counseling and I want to make the most of it, but I just can't bring up what I really want to talk about. Up to date, we've mostly been addressing depression but in more recent days my self-injury and other bad habits have resurfaced and are wreaking emotional havoc. I really need my counselor's help but I can't find the words to start the conversation and I'm scared to reveal how I'm feeling! It's a very embarrassing and even shameful thing for me to talk about. I'm afraid of how he might perceive this. I completely trust him and I know he is experienced and totally qualified, but I'm still afraid of bringing this up even though I really want (and need) to. Any suggestions are appreciated! Thank you!",
    "TherapistReply": "You are feeling frightened and ashamed to talk to your counselor about your problems with self-injury and other “bad habits.” You might worry that your counselor will feel critical or think less of you, even though you know that it is an unlikely reaction to occur to a trained therapist. You know that you must discuss your worries and problems in order for the therapy to work. This is the hardest part of therapy—and the best part, too—because here is where you learn and develop yourself more than almost anywhere else. I have some thoughts and suggestions that might help you out.\n\nYou write that you’ve been meeting with your counselor since September. The first part of therapy usually has to do with developing a relationship of deep trust, and that takes time, as it should. Even though you understand that your counselor is experienced and qualified, you are still getting acquainted and learning to have faith in yourselves and in each other, too. So your first step is to have patience and let the treatment develop.\n\nIt’s also important to understand what a good therapist does. A good therapist has compassion for the parts of you that are destructive, the parts you’re most ashamed of, and can help you see that those parts are protective and well-intentioned—even when it doesn’t feel like it, even when the strategies behind them produce unwanted behaviors and harm.\n\nSometimes, before we are able to talk about what we fear, we have to learn ways to handle feeling afraid. Your counselor might be able to help you become less blown about by the winds of your powerful emotions and more able to navigate your feelings and use that feeling energy for your well-being. Right now it sounds as if you are being controlled by gale-force winds of feelings—at their mercy, really, with little ability to grab the rudder and set out for a particular direction of your choice.You write that you “can’t find the words to start the conversation.” I think that when you are ready for the discussion the words will come—it sounds to me like you have them already. In the meantime, maybe you don’t need words anyway.\n\n“How can I not need words?” you might ask.\n\nMaybe at this point in your treatment, words are less important than simply being comfortable with the person who will help you learn how to live with your strong feelings. Could you ask the counselor if he or she might know some methods for calming the self, centering the self, soothing the self? Breathwork, for example, is one way to calm down, but there are other ways that you might know of already, and with a little encouragement, you can use them.\n\nThese are important issues about caring for yourself. An important part of therapy is learning how to care for yourself. Maybe you could ask for help in self-care, then later get to know who you really are, deep down. Therapy is an exploration, done with a guide who will walk the deep walk with you and protect you in your journey. Feeling safe and good self-care come first.\n\nEventually you will feel safe enough to speak up and communicate your fears and needs more directly. Even now I think you are beginning. Soon you might tell your counselor that you are afraid, that you have a secret and you’re afraid to say what it is. That’s the truth, and the truth is a good place to start."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m Finally Clean, but My Boyfriend Still Uses Drugs",
    "Question": "I am a recovering drug addict, now 15 months sober, who has worked relentlessly to rebuild my life. I was estranged from my children and had to go through a fierce legal battle to even get supervised visitation with them after I got clean. I now see them three times a week, but will have to fight in court with my ex-husband to get more time. Unfortunately, I can't afford the legal costs to do it at this time. After being unemployed for many years, I was able to get a great job where I am moving up quickly and making OK money. (I am currently paying a hefty amount of back child support as well.) With all of these accomplishments, I have one major dark cloud. The boyfriend I had while I was using is still my boyfriend. And still using. We've been on and off since we started, but now live together. Not only does he use drugs regularly, but he has serious anger issues and gets very violent and cruel with me. My family can't understand why I don't just leave him and neither can I. My kids and job are all in one city and I'm choosing to live (and commute) 70 miles each way to make it work. He says he loves me and he wants it to be different and that he's \"trying,\" but there is no effort being put in. He's respectful enough to not do drugs around me, but that makes him gone a lot. It makes it very difficult for us to share a life or have any kind of happiness. I know what the obvious answer is here, but I just can't seem to make myself go. I don't know why my kids aren't enough for me or why I feel like I need this man to make me happy. When things are good with him, they are so good. I really do love him, but it's breaking me. What is wrong with me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your question, and congratulations on your sobriety! Fifteen months is great; clearly, in spite of your current woes, you’re doing something right.\n\nI think the answer to your question is in the question itself. Very often relationships that feel “broken,” dysfunctional, and so on lead to an overall bad feeling about ourselves, or low self-worth or self-esteem that, actually, may precede the relationship itself. I have found in my clinical practice that it is not just the relationship that isn’t working; it is the negative way we have come to see ourselves that defines who we seek as partners.\n\nIf we have a negative self-concept—and I know few newly sober people who don’t—then we may seek out partners who have similar challenges with self-esteem, who then tend to act negatively toward others. Why should we act lovingly toward anyone “dumb enough” to be with us? Or, the flipside of the same coin: we feel we must treat with utmost deference anyone who would be gracious enough to come into our lives, since he or she is doing us such a tremendous favor. We therefore tend to dish out or absorb hurtful behavior that reflects a primal woundedness, unhealed and unconscious, guaranteed to keep us in relational unhappiness until squarely faced.\n\nYour boyfriend treats you with much less than the respect and care you deserve—and you are obviously a caring soul—leaving you in a state, I would imagine, of bewilderment and pain. I would assert that abusive relationships, too, are cunning, baffling, and powerful, probably because there is an aspect of the partner that is “good” or caring and aware of the hurtful outbursts, perhaps even expressing remorse after the curses and fists have flown. We also might feel we “get” the person more than anyone else—that he or she is a sheep in wolf’s clothing, etc., and deserves a chance when everyone else is so against him or her. (Surprisingly, I see a lot of abused husbands and boyfriends in my private practice.) But then it happens yet again, similar to a person with alcoholism who rages while drunk and then makes “never again” promises or refuses to talk about it.It is not at all uncommon for people who have gotten clean and sober to discover a secondary “addiction” or compulsive behavior (or even relationship or some kind). What you have going for you here is a dawning awareness that there is, indeed, something wrong with this picture: an excellent place to start. Try to keep your eyes and senses open to what your actual experience is here, rather than what “ought” to happen or the “tomorrow” that might be better. I also suggest that you try one or two possible options, namely Al-Anon or CoDA (Co-Dependents Anonymous), as well as counseling, since the roots of your own relationship perceptions and beliefs probably, I venture, go very deep indeed. You might also seek out a women’s group in AA or a women’s group where you can talk about these issues (often shameful and painful to discuss with others) and find proper support and feedback from others who have walked in your shoes (or similar shoes). It can be even more difficult to “quit” an abusive (or something like it) relationship, since we so often feel a strong tie with the “caring” or more aware part of the person per the above, even if he/she can’t or won’t stop. (And don’t believe for a second, in your case, that he can’t; he can, trust me, if there is enough consequence for his not doing so—i.e., losing the relationship!)\n\nIt’s time to learn new ways to enforce boundaries, in other words, just as you have done so superbly with the drugs and booze: here again I suggest you define and then communicate to him and, if need be, enforce these boundaries against any verbal, emotional, or physical behavior that crosses the line. There’s no shame in the fact this is difficult, given longstanding beliefs and convictions about ourselves and what we do and don’t deserve, beliefs which may again be unconscious or unarticulated. If we grew up in an abusive environment, we learned that we “must” tolerate chaotic or hurtful behaviors that become commonplace.\n\nFinally, regarding the idea that your kids “should be enough”: watch out for “shoulds”; they only make us feel worse about ourselves. A relationship with children—and congratulations on making amends in that regard, by the way—is naturally quite different than one with a partner. It’s rather like saying, “Why do I need to eat vegetables, I eat plenty of protein and grains”; holistically speaking, we seek and desire different types of love, and naturally, parental love is quite different than intimate or romantic love, which is different than having good friends, etc.\n\nAlso, try to remember that you are a role model for your children. You don’t say if you have daughters or sons, but in either event your children will look to you as a prime example of what to expect from women (if they’re male) or how/what women ought to tolerate in their lives from men (if they’re female). Also, I wonder if your ex-husband might feel more comfortable with expanding visitation times if he knew the boyfriend had stopped his acting out or (if he won’t) were out of the picture? Is it safe for your kids if he is around? I don’t know the details, but it’s something to consider. Thanks again for writing. And keep up the good work in your recovery!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Believe My Father-in-Law Is Abusing My Daughter",
    "Question": "Please help me. I have suspicions that my father-in-law is inappropriately touching my 4-year-old daughter, maybe sexually. But I can't prove it and I know if I dare raise the possibility with my mom she will disown me. I never thought my father-in-law was capable of this, and I don't even know how to go about proving that he is. You're probably wondering where my suspicions come from. Well, I don't leave her alone with him anymore but when all three of us are in a room together she stays as close to me as possible, even hiding behind me, and when I ask her what's wrong, she won't say and just looks scared and tries not to look at him. I catch him looking at her out of the corner of my eye sometimes and I don't know if he's threatened her or what. I've asked him why she seems so scared of him and he just shrugs. She's not like this with anyone else, even other men. I haven't seen physical signs of abuse other than some occasional small bruises that could be explained by child's play. I guess call it \"mother's intuition\" or whatever, but something isn't right. Something is off. Part of me wants to outright ask my daughter if he has touched her, but since I can't say for certain he's guilty of what I suspect, I feel like planting the suggestion in her head would possibly do more harm than good. Should I just outright ask him if he's touched her and see how he responds and risk my mother's wrath (and his)? The one thing I am sure of is that I don't want my daughter being abused and she is unwilling to speak up so far.",
    "TherapistReply": "Of course you are concerned! Anytime we see a behavior like that in a child and she or he is unable or unwilling to explain the change, we fear the worst. Your primary responsibility is to protect your daughter. Your mother and father-in-law may get offended and angry, but that can’t be a reason to ignore your fears.\n\nSince you are working from intuition, it may be worth looking into having an evaluation done with a good, reputable child therapist to explore if anything has happened with your daughter. It is true that you don’t want to plant ideas in her head, but you also want to find out if something scary or inappropriate has happened and help her process it. A good therapist can do that without planting ideas. It may be that your father-in-law has been inappropriate with her. If so, you will want to connect her with professional supports as soon as possible.It also might be that she had a bad dream about him and is now scared of him. It may be that he was stern with her and she got upset and doesn’t want to engage with him. Without knowing more, it is hard to know how to proceed. I don’t want to diminish your concerns—until you know for certain that he is a safe person for her, absolutely continue to make sure that you supervise their interactions.\n\nHow receptive do you think your mother and father-in-law would be to a conversation that explored whether they had noticed a change in the way your daughter is reacting to him? If you approach it from a place of curiosity rather than accusation, you may be able to learn more. If nothing untoward has happened, they may be concerned and confused as well.\n\nThat said, if you want to wait to address any of this with them until you have more information, you can certainly do so. You know your family dynamics and should proceed in the safest way possible for everyone, particularly your daughter."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Avoid Being Dragged Down by a Depressing World?",
    "Question": "Every day the world disappoints me a little more. The news is full of tragedy and disappointment, from atrocities in foreign lands to stories of domestic abuse close to home. Murder, racism, hunger, homelessness—there's no end to it. As a citizen I feel like it's my duty to stay informed and to know what's going on around me; I don't think the answer is to just stick my head in the sand and pretend the world isn't full of injustice, greed, and hate. But at the same time, knowing this is a weight on my soul. I don't know how to reconcile my thirst for knowledge with the depression and exasperation that comes from quenching this thirst. I know there are good people in the world doing good things, but those are not the things I see every day, those are not the things that dominate the news cycle. It's all just so ... heavy and dark and ugly. And I feel like I get dragged down just a little bit further each day. What am I supposed to do about this? What can I do? There's only so far a person can be dragged down.",
    "TherapistReply": "Let me start off by saying, I hear you! I actually recently noticed that watching too much news was getting me down a bit, too. I cut back and shifted my focus to other, more uplifting things and I feel some relief. That may or may not work for you. It seems like you are haunted by this on a deeper level and feel a strong sense of duty to be well informed about the world around you.\n\nI wonder if at least part of the answer for you could be getting more involved. You mentioned knowing that there are good people doing good things in the world, but you indicate that you aren’t really exposed to them. Is there an organization near you that you could get involved with that works on a cause that you feel strongly about? There are many different options. You could volunteer in a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, work behind the scenes in fundraising or public relations, or get involved in activism on a grassroots or legislative level. Contributing to the betterment of the world and surrounding yourself with people who are also committed to that cause might help you to find some much-needed hope and inspiration.\n\nI also find myself feeling curious about what else is going on in your life. Are there other things, on a more personal level, that are getting you down? Sometimes when we are unhappy with our own lives, it can be even harder to endure the tragedy and injustices of the world.\n\nAt some point, sadly, all of us need to come to terms with the fact there is much suffering and cruelty in the world and we’re largely powerless to change the balance. There is so much love and joy, yet simultaneously so much pain and misery. In the same way many of us are compelled to face our own mortality, we also have an opportunity to find some meaning in the face of all the suffering. Along the lines of Viktor Frankl‘s book, Man’s Search for Meaning, in which he wrote, “What is to give light must endure burning,” you might benefit to see that there is silver lining of sorts to all this suffering. If it were not for suffering, we would not grow and become more evolved beings; likewise, joy could not exist without its counterpart, pain.\n\nYou are clearly a sensitive being, like many of us who don’t have defense mechanisms strong enough to keep us happily oblivious and in denial. Therefore, it’s even more important for you to do your deeper work to identify and truly care for the “weight on your soul.” Doing this will help you find some meaning in it all, keep you persevering, and give you some sense of hope.\n\nPartnering with a therapist to explore your thoughts and feelings about the world, and your place in it, could be helpful in sorting some of this out. Engaging in therapy might help you to create some positive changes in yourself and the world around you, and I suspect that would make you feel much less dejected—maybe even happy (or happier)."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is It Friendship If You Have Nothing in Common Anymore?",
    "Question": "Hello! I need some advice. I'm a working stiff in my late thirties. As a college student in the late 1990s, I met a guy through mutual friends and we became best buds. We had a lot in common—sports mostly. Now here we are 15 years later, and he lives halfway across the country from me. We talk maybe a couple of times a year and text maybe five times a year. We've visited each other a few times over those 15 years, but not anytime in the past five. We just don't have much in common anymore. He's married with kids. I'm single and like it that way. He's hardcore conservative. I'm very liberal. He posts ignorant jibber jabber on Facebook and we get into fairly heated debates, some might say arguments. If not for our history at college, I can't imagine I'd like this dude! And I'm not sure I do even now. Our friendship feels more like an obligation to me than a genuine friendship. I kind of feel guilty about that. I don't know if I'm just not being a good friend or if I'm just pretending we're friends at this point for the sake of nostalgia. What do you think? Should I try to rekindle the friendship in hopes there's still a viable ember, or am I better off accepting that this friendship isn't worth the effort and simply appreciate it for what it was (but is no more)? Thanks!",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your question. I guess the simple and perhaps even smart-alecky answer would be, “Don’t talk about politics and stick to sports!” I have very good friends who disagree with me politically and we are so passionate about our respective views that we simply agree to disagree. With others, I find it a little easier to have a more moderately tempered exchange; for example, I have a college buddy on Facebook who has drifted to the opposite end of the spectrum as me, but he has a sense of humor and pokes fun at my “side” and we have a good-natured sparring relationship about it. I could not do that with everyone.\n\nBut on a broader and philosophical level, your question points to a very psychologically significant phenomenon—related to change and, perhaps, loss.\n\nThe sometimes jarring fact of the matter is people change. There are friends from my past, as I sit here in middle age, whom I would no longer recognize. Some I am happy to stay in touch with via Facebook, and some I just can’t find common ground with anymore. A lot of this is about the present: the ongoing, indestructible present moment, which creates a context around what remains in common today. And other than a shared past, there are some with whom we just don’t share much in common anymore. Sometimes a new place—geographically, emotionally—can change a person, which changes his or her relationships. Sounds like your friend has changed for reasons that, I’m guessing, have little to do with you, but do affect the friendship.\n\nWe all exist in a particular context, often fleeting, ever shifting. (This would be related to what Buddhists call “groundlessness.”) In the case of your friend, you and he shared some very intense experiences in a common setting, but obviously things have changed in more complicated ways than can be assessed by the human eye. It sounds to me like you would have to make an adjustment to “fit” this new situation by listening to the “jibber jabber” of your friend’s politics. Perhaps these politics have become important to him for some reason that blocks more friendly relating. Could you ask him to drop this as a topic? Or is life too short to even bother at this point?\n\nI was curious about the notion of an “obligation” to him, and I think that warrants further investigation. Why “obligation”? What are the risks of not following this new “requirement”? My sense is that not staying obligated might bring with it a loss of a kind that could be symbolic for you: for example, this friend was like a brother, and losing him might be related to experiencing a brotherly loss of a kind. Maybe you feel you’ve lost too many “friends” lately. Is there a loneliness losing him might touch on? Or perhaps there are people in your life like him, and for some reason you feel like you “owe” it to them to stay uncomfortable listening to opinions that seriously clash with yours. There is something abrasive about feeling “forced” to listen to political opinions that don’t jibe with yours; it sounds as if it might be more of a monologue than a conversation. “Fun for one,” as a friend likes to say. It does you no good to force yourself in such situations. I suppose you could try to “understand” his positions, if you’re interested, but that’s a lot of work on your part, and it may or may not be worth it.\n\nMore importantly, why hold on to this particular friendship if it’s no longer fun or friendly? It sounds like your college pal now wants your audience as more than a friend, from what you’ve said. Assuming he’s going to cling to his political points of view, what purpose does it serve by pretending a friendship is there that has changed or even faded away? I get a sad feeling while writing this, since people do come in and then out of our lives in a way that can spark specific feelings in us, depending on who we are and how we process these experiences.\n\nIn short, see if getting politics out of the equation helps, or if by continuing this friendship you are staving off inevitable feelings of loss that, unfortunately, are as difficult in life as connections are rewarding. You seem like a nice, considerate fellow, and I’m hoping there are people in your life whom you can spend more time with, rather than forcing a situation that no longer suits your particular context. Thank you for writing!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Mom’s Leaving Me with Hurt, Guilt, Resentment, and Anger",
    "Question": "I am 21 years old and a senior in college, yet I feel that I have been taking care of my mom for the past 11 months. In January, my sister left home and never returned and refuses to speak to my mom. My mom, obviously upset, started leaning on me for support, which I was happy to give because she's my mom and I believed she would do the same for me. However, she became increasingly depressed and paranoid, threatening to commit suicide, not answering my calls for days at a time with no explanation, and believes that I will abandon her one day in the future too. I reassured her time and time again that I would never leave her, but it seems to be a constant source of worry. Eventually, this took a toll on our own relationship, and I started to feel resentment toward her—how dare she accuse me of such an act after I woke up in the middle of the night multiple times to console her while she cries, or helped to track my sister down when my mom needed to know her whereabouts! She has told me numerous times that she feels like she lost a daughter, and that her efforts to make a \"perfect family\" have failed miserably. Eventually, my mom started nitpicking on my own life and decisions since I was the only one she felt attached to (my dad is very distant from all this). She reads all of my bank statements and will not let me spend any of the money I earn from my own jobs. Obviously, this has become yet another source of conflict between us, and I eventually started withholding information from her and sometimes lying because I found that I have neither the time nor the energy to inform her of my every move and deal with her reactions. However, as predicted, the truth always comes out, and that is exactly what happened recently. After a stint of silence from my mom, she emailed me and said she is leaving the family and does not want to see anyone, and that \"good people who care about others never lie\" and that I would never change my \"lying ways.\" She had apparently been thinking about leaving for a while but didn't know \"when the best time would be to tell me.\" I feel hurt, helpless, confused, and guilty. I am hurt because I feel like all of the time and energy I have put into helping her cope these past 11 months has been a waste, since she was planning on leaving anyway. I feel guilty because I feel that my lies have driven her to abandon the family. However, these feelings war with the resentment and fury I feel toward her. I am furious with her for accusing me of not caring about her when, ESPECIALLY these past 11 months, I have put my own life on hold to help her whenever she needed me. I am also so upset at the fact I spend all my time reassuring her that I will never leave, when in reality she is the one walking out on me. Please help me to accept the fact she is leaving and help me to move on with my life. I still have school and two jobs, and I don't understand how I'm going to be able to handle these three things. Thank you!",
    "TherapistReply": "First, I want to tell you that you are absolutely entitled to all of your feelings—even the ones that seem to contradict each other. Relationships are very complex; there is room for many different emotions. You may be able to achieve a little bit of peace if you give yourself permission to end the war between hurt, helplessness, confusion, guilt, resentment, and fury. You don’t have to choose; you can have them all.\n\nFrom what you have written about your mother, it seems like she is in considerable pain and struggling with a lot of her own issues. It is very possible that her intensely protective behavior toward you is indicative of her own deep wounds. She may be trying to protect you from sustaining the wounds that she has experienced in her own life. In other words, her behavior is not about you, but rather her own suffering. Sometimes realizing this, and constantly reminding yourself of it, can go a long way toward not taking her behavior personally.\n\nHer behavior is clearly taking a toll on her, you, your relationship with her, and probably many other relationships in her life—remember, this is about her, not you, so it certainly impacts her relationships with others. It sounds like she could really benefit from being in therapy, if she isn’t already. You may wish to encourage her to pursue this. That said, at the end of the day, your mom has to make her own choice about whether to get help. While you can suggest it, encourage it, and even offer to help her find it, you can’t make her do it.\n\nIn fact, the only thing you do have control over is your behavior. It sounds like your mom is behaving in some pretty self-destructive ways and she is really hurting you. While it can be tempting to try to find ways to control her—to make her get help, to make her see that you have sacrificed so much to be there for her, to make her know that she is loved—you simply cannot. Your mom is the only person in the world who can control what she does. Likewise, you can control what you do. So, it is probably time to shift the focus to yourself. Partnering with your own therapist to work through the hurt and pain, which likely lurks beneath the fury, can help you stop personalizing your mom’s behavior and develop more productive ways of coping.\n\nIn addition to therapy, I would suggest being compassionate and patient with yourself, and doing all that you can to make yourself as comfortable as possible. It can be very painful to have a parent like this. Everyone deserves to have a consistently loving, nurturing mom who makes them feel safe. While your mom was unable to provide this for you, maybe part of your healing will be learning how to provide it for yourself. Try to take good care of yourself—eat well, exercise, and get a good amount of sleep. Seek out friends and family members who you trust and feel safe with to support you. You’ve been so focused on your mom for so long, it’s time to keep the focus on you and your needs."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Caught My Mom Cheating and She Begged Me to Keep It Secret",
    "Question": "I am hoping you can help me with what to do here. I am 17. Last week I caught my mom having sex with someone who is not my dad. My parents have been married for like 20 years and this was a shock to me, to say the least. My dad was at work and I came home from a friend's house unexpectedly. They were in the living room and I saw the guy roll off of my mom and pull some clothes on when he saw me. My mom was embarrassed obviously and tried to explain it away but later that night she told me she made a mistake and to please not tell my dad. I feel like I am closer to my mom than my dad but I love them both and I am really feeling like it's wrong for me not to say something to my dad. I just feel bad for him knowing that he has no idea of what is going on. I feel like my mom should tell him what happened, but if she doesn't, is that my place? My mom has begged me not to and says it will never happen again. I am not sure if I believe her, though. My mom and dad seemed happy and this is all just so shocking to me. I don't know how to move past it.",
    "TherapistReply": "I’m so sorry you find yourself in this position. I imagine you feel like you either have to be disloyal to your mom and tell your dad, or be disloyal to your dad and keep this secret from him. That is a no-win situation.\n\nSo, let’s look at it differently.\n\nRelationships between intimate partners are complex, and your mom and dad will have to figure their own stuff out. Your mom’s choices about her relationship with your dad and the consequences of those choices really are between the two of them. I am not here to pass judgment about your mom’s apparent infidelity. I will say that her asking you to hold her secret is a betrayal of her relationship with you. It is part of the unspoken parenting contract that parents don’t put their kids in a position to have to choose which parent to betray or be loyal to. That’s not right or fair. It doesn’t matter if this was a one-time thing or a pattern of behavior—it’s not your role to weigh out the details and possible consequences.\n\nI suggest you have a conversation with your mom but, for now, leave your dad and his feelings out if it. Focus instead on what her request is doing to you and to your relationship with her. Asking you to hold her secret is asking you to carry the responsibility for her choices. That is a breach of trust with you that could have long-lasting implications. It cannot be your responsibility to cover for her, nor should it be your responsibility to inform your dad. This isn’t about you loving her enough to keep her secret; it is about her loving you enough not to ask you to. You cannot force her to own her actions. If, however, when presented with your feelings she still chooses to put you on the middle, you may want to ask yourself what you are protecting.\n\nNone of this is easy, so if you find yourself struggling, I suggest finding a therapist near you to work through some of this with. No matter what happens, having some support may be beneficial in helping you move past this."

    "Question": "Hi, I had been seeing my therapist on and off (due to me traveling in and out of the country) for the past month and a half, and today when I wanted to schedule my fourth session with her, she told me that she is not taking any more sessions. I was shocked because this termination was very abrupt. I have abandonment issues and unresolved anger which I desperately needed to discuss in the fourth session, and then she's gone. The worst part is that she reminded me of someone who left me a few years ago—and I actually told her that in the second session. This feels like being abandoned all over again, and although I've seen her for only three sessions, I feel that ache in my chest. She did not even suggest that we have another session to end things properly. I would have been able to make peace with that if we had one last time to \"tie loose ends,\" even if this means I have to see another therapist after that session. I feel very hurt with this incident. What can you suggest that I do next?",
    "TherapistReply": "It’s easy to understand why you feel hurt; your experience with this therapist is a reminder of previous abandonments in your life. Perhaps those abandonments are even the reason you are seeking a therapeutic relationship—so you can work out your feelings. Good for you! Working through complicated feelings, and arriving at a better understanding of why you feel them, is one of the great benefits of psychotherapy.\n\nYou have an “ache in your chest,” need help, and have the courage and wisdom to seek it. Unfortunately, you did not find the help you were looking for this time, but I hope that this experience will not put you off of therapy, and that you will try, try again with someone new. Although I don’t know some of the specifics regarding your situation, it seems to me that your experience with this particular therapist is not typical.\n\nI am not sure of the exact timing of your sessions, such as when your treatment started, when the first three meetings took place, and when the hiatus occurred. Knowing the sequence and the rhythm of the proceedings would make it a bit easier to understand what might have happened. In any event, although you describe your relationship with the therapist as “on and off,” you were committed to the treatment and you felt surprised when you called to schedule your fourth session and found that she was unavailable. Clearly, you were expecting her to wait for you to come back and you felt hurt when she wasn’t there. In short, you were “on” but she was “off.”\n\nBest I can tell, the therapist ended treatment over the phone. The usual practice is to meet together in person before terminating treatment. I agree with you that a face-to-face meeting would have been more appropriate. It is possible that the therapist’s time simply filled up while you were away and scheduling became more difficult, but I wish you had both tried to find a time that worked for the two of you to meet. That clearly would have helped you move forward, if only in the direction of another therapist you would feel more embraced by.\n\nYou wanted to say goodbye and achieve some closure to understand what was going on and maybe even feel better, as you mention in your letter. I’m curious as to what you feel a proper ending looks like—what you want to say to her, and what you want her to say to you. What are the “loose ends” you want to tie up? These are important issues, and I hope you discuss them with your next therapist.\n\nYou also asked for advice about what to do next. Again, I hope this experience won’t stop you from starting anew with another therapist. Find a therapist who can help you learn how to participate in a relationship that is, simply, “on.”"

    "QuestionTitle": "Childhood Trauma Left Me Feeling Worthless and Depressed",
    "Question": "I was in eighth grade when my mother picked me up at school, telling me that she was leaving my father. I never knew how much your life could change in one day. It turned out that she had already rented a house and had been slowly moving in. I ended up living with my dad, and my mom said we would talk all the time, but we really didn’t. Even though that was the worst year of my life, I actually have a hard time remembering most of it. All I remember is crying myself to sleep every night I was missing my mother so much. I felt worthless, like I wasn’t good enough. My dad also was depressed and developed bipolar disorder. I also felt abandoned by him because all he did was hide in his garage because he was depressed himself. It was extremely lonely. It’s hard to live a life feeling like you’re not wanted. In my teens, I felt depressed and suicidal. I became very cut off from the world. I did not hang out with friends, I did not date, and I did not do anything involved with school. Now I am 20 years old, still a virgin, still depressed, have social anxiety, and when I see alcohol I am so tempted to just drink until I can’t no more. Even though I don’t drink now, I just have a strong feeling that one day I will be an alcoholic; when things start getting bad, I just want to drink. I guess I’m just seeking advice on what to do? I’ve never seen a counselor or a therapist.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for your question. Boy, oh boy were you put through the wringer. My heart ached to read of your experiences. I suppose the short version of my answer would be to see a therapist soon as you can, if only for the reason that you mention suicidality from your teens and depression today. This is not to be alarmist, but depression is something you don’t want to go unaddressed for long, more a sign of trauma than any “character issues.”\n\nClearly, your mother’s traumatic flight and your dad’s withdrawal left psychological scars that now need attending. This is not to blame anyone; the tragedy of mental health issues (you mentioned your father’s depression) is that those afflicted often end up passing on their condition by creating, as the authority figure in the home, a psychological mood or atmosphere of depression, anxiety, etc., which children are liable to absorb. They don’t call them the “formative years” for nothing. These wounds are passed along from generation to generation until someone has the courage to say “enough” and get some professional help. The good news is that you are young and in an excellent position to get help, and in so doing, start life over again and find contentment and purposeful living. Your experience, believe it or not, can be a vehicle for compassion and empathy for others down the road.\n\nI am a fan of author and psychoanalyst George Atwood, who says in his excellent book The Abyss of Madness that, to paraphrase, people become depressed when depressing things happen to them. There are so many ways in which your trauma would upend anyone’s psyche. The most common question people ask me is, “Is this normal?” I usually say I gave up on normal a long time ago. Also, we therapists can relate to the childhoods and suffering of the people we work with more than we sometimes let on.\n\nYet another wounding occurs when the abandonment pain is not acknowledged or permitted to “exist.” A depressed parent may withdraw for self-protection and neglect the child, who cannot help but take it personally. Of course, as a young adult you now want to drink alcohol and blot it all out. What happened was wounding indeed, but not only were you alone with the abandonment, but you also had no one to even acknowledge or help you cope with its scarring legacy. Thus you were in the impossible situation in that you couldn’t have or not have these feelings; the terrible loneliness you experienced was compounded by not having a caring witness to empathize and help bear your very understandable feelings—a kind of solitary confinement.\n\nYou sound like a psychologically resilient person who survived a very difficult upbringing, who cares enough to do something about it now. I would encourage you look for a therapist who understands the kind of trauma you experienced, someone who is willing to be patient with you as these injuries to selfhood—which, actually, you seem to have borne quite nobly or you wouldn’t even be writing—begin to heal. Consuming vast quantities of drink or drugs is understandably tempting, but I encourage you not to. In the end, it will only erode your self-esteem and, in a sense, repeat the abuse by neglecting the hurt that needs a safe place for healing. You’re worth the effort (even if it doesn’t always feel like it). Thanks again for writing."

    "QuestionTitle": "After 32 Years, I’m Ready to Leave My Wife and Take a Chance",
    "Question": "I am a man who has been married to my wife for 32 years. I told her I loved her five days after I met her. She was also my first sexual experience. I was 23 and she was 18. We both said it was a love-at-first-sight thing, and I'll still agree to that today. But now it's 32 years later. We have two grown daughters, one who has given us two grandchildren, and another who married and left her husband a little over a year into their marriage. I am like others I've read here. I am no longer in love with my wife, although I do care for her a lot. I have never cheated on her, but I picture myself in a single-life situation with the ability to date all the time. I will say that two years ago I did meet a woman I work with, and we hit it off immediately. We have traveled together with our job, and even spent a week together in Wyoming, although nothing happened. To this day, we talk on a daily basis, sometimes for hours. She knows about my family, and I know and have met her family. She has two teenage boys and a teenage girl, and I do believe they like me. I have been to her house on several occasions just to talk or watch a movie, and have even had a few meals with her. I guess my point being that what I have with her is what I had with my wife when we met, but in my eyes aren't even close to having anymore. There is a 20-year age difference between my friend and I, but it doesn't seem to bother either of us. We have told each other that we are each other's best friends, and told each other that we love each other and could never see that changing. My wife is aware of her existence, since we do work together occasionally. We would sometimes be on the phone together when my family was all in the house, but not on purpose, that's just the way it worked out. My wife finally confronted me about it, saying it bothered her and that I seemed happier talking with my friend than I did with her, which is pretty much accurate. At the end of the day, I can't see myself spending the rest of my life with my wife or without her. And more and more, I see my life with my female friend and her family. There is nothing set in stone, and we have never talked about that aspect because I am married. But I think if I were to divorce my wife, it could happen. I believe the one thing that has stopped me from leaving is the turmoil it would create with my children and grandchildren, but I have to do something for me, not anybody else. This thought process consumes my life daily. I'm tired of being smothered by my wife trying to prove she loves me, and if I don't do something about it soon, I will lose the opportunity to live the rest of my days in happiness. If it seems like I've rambled on, I'm sorry. It's the frustration of what I am facing.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thank you for reaching out and asking these important questions. I appreciate how hard it is to ask for help and I’m really glad you did. I am going to share my thoughts on your situation as candidly as possible.\n\nYou say, “I’ve never cheated on my wife,” and I would venture that you are talking about never having had sexual contact outside of your marriage. However, there is another side to infidelity that many people are unaware of or fail to acknowledge—the emotional affair. An emotional affair is when a married or committed partner turns to an individual outside of the partnership to fulfill emotional needs. The situation you are describing with your coworker sounds like an emotional affair, especially because it appears that your wife is not aware of the type and amount of contact you have had with this woman.\n\nWhile affairs may progress in any number of ways, they don’t generally “just happen.” Affairs happen by a series of small compromises: sharing secrets with someone other than your partner; doing things with someone that more often than not should be reserved for your partner, such as going to the movies or having nice meals out; and hiding behavior. Eventually, many people find themselves in an all-out affair. While I’m not suggesting that you are having an affair, you are certainly on a slippery slope, and it is apparent that this “friendship” is taking a toll on your marriage. Even if nothing has happened yet, there is a very real possibility that could change very quickly.\n\nThere are a few significant things that make a relationship with someone outside of a partner so enticing. For one, it’s new. As anyone who has ever purchased a new car can attest, the newness of the car is exciting. You can’t wait to show it off, tell everyone about it, and you burst with excitement every time you drive it. After a while, however, the newness wears off and you get accustomed to it. Then, you become more aware of its quirks and maintenance costs. At this point, some people will trade in for a newer car to try to recapture that feeling.\n\nIn marriage, the concept is the same—when you met your wife, it was new and exciting. Now, after 32 years, two children, two grandchildren, and a life together, the newness is gone. The excitement has worn off, and you know this woman like you know yourself. I suspect that is part of what makes the relationship with this other woman so exciting—it’s new. There are new things to learn, explore, and share, while with your wife you may be feeling like you’ve been there, done that.\n\nStarting a new relationship after a long marriage can be exciting, but I must caution you that the friendship you describe is steeped in fantasy; almost every new relationship is. At this point, your life with your wife is full of responsibility and with the daily tasks of living—the bills, kids, grandkids, work, college tuition, and household chores. The relationship with the other woman doesn’t have any of those components now, but should you choose to end your marriage and start a life with her, those elements will be present along with the added challenge of blending families. Before you make any big decision, it’s important to step back and look at this from a realistic perspective, beyond the fantasy and romantic idealization.\n\nFinally, you state that you want to be happy and that you’re concerned that you will lose the opportunity to live your days in happiness. From my perspective, happiness is an internal condition. Viktor Frankl reminds us that the “last of the human freedoms [is] to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” You are making your happiness contingent on what happens in your life and your relationships, when your focus really ought to be on how to find fulfillment, happiness, and joy in your life on your own. If there is one thing that is constant in this life, it is that nothing stays the same. Therefore, the highest task of living, in my opinion, is learning how to surf the waters of life and maintaining an inner sense of peace, joy, and happiness … no matter what is happening.\n\nYou do not have an easy choice to make in this situation, and I would encourage you to seek out someone to talk with you about this. A good therapist can help you navigate the waters and help you become aware of things you may not presently see."

    "QuestionTitle": "Being My Husband’s Caretaker Has Me Angry and Bitter. Help!",
    "Question": "My husband is blind as a result of diabetes and is NOT following doctors' orders. Since I am his caretaker now because of his disability, I am extremely angry and bitter. I need someone to help me because I'm on the verge of breakdown. I need help, please. And because we are no longer working, our finances cannot afford us to pay for counseling. But I NEED some tolerance training or compassion training to be a caretaker for my husband.",
    "TherapistReply": "The intensity of your feelings is coming through loud and clear. And it is understandable. Being a full-time caretaker can be all-consuming and exhausting. You never get to leave your job. Doctors and nurses who work with high-needs populations get to go home at the end of their shifts, and they aren’t personally connected to their patients. Caretakers of family don’t have either of those luxuries, and it can take a significant toll on their health and well-being.\n\nBefore you can focus on being a more tolerant or compassionate caretaker to your husband, I think it might be wise to focus on taking care of yourself. Are you engaging in any self-care practices? Even simple practices such as going for walks, taking hot baths, reading a good book, or spending time with friends might allow you to cool off and help recharge you. Are any other family members, relatives, or friends in position to pitch in from time to time and give you a much-needed break?\n\nIt sounds like you are dealing with a lot of anger toward your husband since he played a significant role in creating the situation you are both forced to live with now. You are absolutely entitled to your feelings of anger. Having said that, it seems like they are eating you up and morphing into bitterness. This does not feel good. You don’t deserve that.\n\nWorking toward forgiveness may help in coping with this. People tend to think that forgiveness is for other people (the people who are being forgiven), but it is often more for the person who is doing the forgiving. It is certainly a process, but beginning the process might alleviate some of the anger and bitterness you are experiencing. You deserve that relief.\n\nIt sounds like you need more support than you are getting. There are a lot of caretaker support groups out there, and some of them are free. Ask your husband’s medical providers if they know of any local support groups you can join. You can also go to the American Diabetes Association website to get connected to an office in your community that will likely have caretaker resources available.\n\nThe bottom line is this: The better you are able to take care of yourself, the better you will be able to take care of your husband, and the more comfortable you will be while you are doing it."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Learn to Open Up to My Therapist?",
    "Question": "How do I open up to a therapist? I'm on my fourth therapist in about three years, and I have a terrible time talking to them about myself. I can't even bring up the boring, inconsequential things in my life without a lot of anxiety. It doesn't seem to matter whether the therapist is male, female, young, or old. People always tell me that therapists are not likely to judge me; they can't reject me like a friend would; I'm paying for these sessions, so I should get my money's worth by spilling my guts. I know all that is true, but I just can't get over the fact that I'm telling this stranger really intimate stuff about my past. I was with my first therapist for over two years before I started to tell him about trauma in my past, even though I knew it was a huge factor in my mental health issues. And what's strange is that I don't have a problem opening up to friends. I don't think I have trust issues, because I tend to be much more open with friends than with therapists. The problem is that my friends don't have PhDs or a license to give me advice, which is really what I need. So my friends get frustrated because they can't help, and I get frustrated because I'm not actually any closer to getting rid of anxiety and depression. How can I overcome my fears about talking to therapists so I can start working on my issues?",
    "TherapistReply": "First, let me applaud your courage in seeking out therapy and for reaching out to GoodTherapy.org with your question. It is no small thing to acknowledge that one needs help, so bravo to you for taking those steps.\n\nYour question of how to open up to a therapist is quite common. Many people feel overwhelmed at the possibility of sharing their deepest, darkest secrets and pain with a virtual stranger. It seems especially frustrating when you are paying for the services but still can’t seem to open up. However, this is perfectly normal, and many people find themselves in that position. There are a few things that might contribute to this: you may not have developed the level of trust you need to feel safe with the therapist you are working with, you may be fearful of being judged by the therapist, or maybe you are afraid that opening the pain of the past might be too much to handle. There are many reasons for people not opening up in therapy, so I will give you some ideas on how to get things going.\n\nIf you’ve ever heard the saying, “If something scares you, you must do it immediately,” this will sound familiar. You have to build trust with your therapist AND with yourself—with your therapist, you need to know that he or she has the capacity to hold whatever pain you might share, and you need to know that you can handle sharing your past without falling apart, losing control, or being overtaken. The best way to do this is by taking small steps. First, I suggest talking with your therapist specifically about your inability to open up. This type of honest conversation can be a bridge to building trust in other areas. Second, after having that conversation, intentionally decide to take risks and share honestly in your therapy sessions. Even if you don’t want to share the trauma of the past, you can say, “I’m really anxious because I want to share, but I’m afraid of …” Simply naming the anxiety when it appears can help clear the way through it.\n\nFinally, many people are concerned that the therapist will judge them when they share openly. While I can’t say that there aren’t therapists who judge, they are firmly in the minority. Therapists generally hold a genuine space of empathy and high regard for the people they work with, knowing that each individual has had a unique “pain journey” and that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but rather of deep strength. Your therapist is a stranger only as long as you keep him or her that way. By taking small risks and building trust, you will deepen your relationship with your therapist, which will help your therapy progress.\n\nYou can make this therapeutic experience what you want it to be by taking ownership for how it has gone and making active choices in how to handle it going forward. I believe that you want this to work, and I believe that it will because you are willing to work. Best wishes in your journey!"

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I Can’t Stop Thinking about My Therapist",
    "Question": "I have been seeing my therapist for four years. I really like my therapist, and she has been helping me a lot. The problem is, I think about her 24/7. What she is doing, etc. I look for her or her car every time I go out to a restaurant, etc. The attachment is NOT erotic. I know she is married and I do not want to have sex with her (I am female, by the way). How do I get her out of my head except when I'm in therapy?",
    "TherapistReply": "Although I can’t know what is happening in your therapy and how this may pertain to your question, clearly this is an important issue, and I hope you will discuss it directly with your therapist. I can understand that perhaps you feel reluctant to bring it up, but the ensuing conversation might be very helpful, and it could move the work you are doing together toward a deeper understanding of your relationship with her and, most importantly, with yourself.\n\nAny emotional reaction, especially one as pervasive as what you describe, contains clues that you want to identify and investigate. For example, at some stages of development obsession is quite natural, and your obsession might be pointing toward a difficult time in your life that needs work. Young children, for example, are obsessed with their caregivers, often their mothers. If this is the root of your issue, you might learn that there was a difficult experience in your childhood that needs to be looked at. Maybe when you were very young, a toddler or a baby, you had fears that your mother or another important person in your life might leave you, never to return—that you might be abandoned. Perhaps you did in fact lose someone you loved. Teenagers, even adults, are sometimes obsessed with someone they see as a role model. They are obsessed because that person is someone they want to be and knows things they need to learn.\n\nAn interesting aspect of therapy is an experience called “transference.” Transference means that the feelings you have for someone important in your life are unconsciously transferred to another person—in this case the therapist. We all have feelings like that; it’s quite normal. For example, people at work often relate to the boss as if the boss was their father or mother, and they might not even know it. Or your irresponsible coworker might remind you of your younger brother or sister. It’s helpful when we become aware of such feelings and then take care to recognize and correct them rather than simply reacting. Therapy can help you do that.\n\nLet’s talk about therapy, some of its general goals, and how they may apply to your situation.\n\nSpeak your mind to your therapist, without concern for feeling silly, looking stupid, being insulting, or whatever worries tend to stop you from speaking up. Honesty makes for a strong therapeutic relationship.\nThere are many different kinds of obsessions—obsession with the Internet, with sports, with movie stars, with teachers, even with one’s therapist. A therapist, after all, is someone who is trying to help. It makes sense that we become attached to kind and helpful people. Who wouldn’t? Maybe, for you, this is a rare experience of being truly understood, you can’t quite believe it’s real, and you don’t want to let it go.\nThe love and gratitude we feel when we are accepted and understood is boundless. Certainly, I feel greatly attached to my teachers, mentors, and therapists. The thought that these connections are partly real and partly transference is kind of sad. “What,” I might think, “you mean this isn’t real?”\nIt is real, the feelings are real, but they are not to be acted on—they are to be explored with words only. These feelings and the therapeutic relationship are on a different and special plane, apart from the everyday world in certain ways. That is the tragedy, glory, and power of any deep therapeutic relationship.\nHow lovely that you have such strong feelings about your therapist. It means that you have been reached at a deep level, which has given you and your therapist a strong energic ground from which to proceed.\n\nI hope this has been helpful. Please let me know what you think. Take care!"

    "QuestionTitle": "How Do I Tell My Girlfriend That Her Teenage Daughter Is an Issue?",
    "Question": "Hi, I am 26 and my girlfriend is 36. She is a single mother with a 17-year-old daughter. We both love each other very much, but sometimes I struggle with the fact she has a daughter. I come from a very traditionalist family where such a situation would be frowned upon—never mind the fear I expect when we tell them that she already has a daughter with no father on the scene. How do I reconcile myself with these thoughts of resentment toward the fact that she already has a daughter? After a year, she also wants me to move in with her and her daughter. How do I tell her that I would find it extremely difficult living with her 17-year-old daughter without hurting her feelings?",
    "TherapistReply": "It sounds like there are two main issues for you right now: managing your feelings and hesitation about dating someone with a teenage daughter, and dealing with your fears about how your family will respond to your situation and the woman you love.\n\nThe fact is your girlfriend is a mom. Nothing is going to change that. You can wish it weren’t so, but that is a big part of who she is. It also may be that her experiences as a mom made her into the person you fell in love with.\n\nI’m curious about where your resentment is coming from. Is it mostly coming from fears about how your family will react, or are there other issues at play? You knew she was a mother when you started dating her. You have been in a relationship with her for a year. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of moving in together, you owe it to her, yourself, and your relationship to have an honest conversation about that. Her feelings may get hurt, but avoiding the issue and letting these feelings fester in secret can do much more damage to your relationship. If you need support in how to have that kind of conversation, you may want to reach out to a therapist in your area for individual or couples work.\n\nDating someone who has kids can be complicated. Something that makes your situation potentially even more complicated is the spread of ages. You are, in fact, closer in age to the daughter than the mother. How much of that is factoring in to your unease? Would you feel the same way if her daughter were 7 instead of 17?\n\nAs for how your family reacts to your relationship, you cannot control what your family thinks or feels. They may disapprove of your relationship. They may disapprove of your girlfriend. It is up to you how much importance you give to their feelings. At 26, you are an adult who can make his own decisions. If the way your family feels about your partner is a deal-breaker, then it is important to be honest about that. Her past is not going away. If, however, you choose to be in relationship with this woman, it is not fair of you to judge or condemn her for her past. Your family can choose to disapprove. Only you can choose to let that matter.\n\nI hope this helps shed some light on your situation. I hope you can resolve your internal conflict and highly recommend seeking the support of a therapist to help guide you through it."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Was Once My Husband’s Mistress. Now I Can’t Trust Him!",
    "Question": "I was the \"other woman\" in my current husband's life. To all the women who have been cheated on, let me tell you: karma is a b*tch. They will get what they deserve and you don't have to do anything—it happens. I want to trust my husband but can't. The things we did to get away with cheating are the same things that haunt me now. I can't shake the feeling that he is now cheating on me. I see things that look familiar to those things we used to do while cheating. I love him but can't trust him, which causes a lot of conflict in our marriage. I am in constant fear/suspicion every day. How can I even put it aside and move forward? It's been six years! I want to be able to trust but cannot.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your question. Six years is a long time to be living with this kind of uncertainty! And not only is this situation more common than you might realize, but the concept of certainty, or security, is often at the heart of this existential dilemma—which is something all of us want and need, though it often proves elusive.\n\nWhen we begin an affair with someone who is unavailable (via marriage or otherwise), there is certainty in the fact we definitely want him or her but can’t. This creates a very specific kind of focus around the question, “Will he or she leave or not?” If the answer is “yes,” very often it seems to be “evidence” of our worthiness: that we and not the other woman (or man) is the winner. We may start to feel resentful of our lover’s spouse, thinking he or she doesn’t deserve the one we love. There may be guilt, too, or most likely a mixture of conflicting feelings and desires.\n\nThen one day it happens, and he or she is ours—except the imagined happy life we’d been yearning for isn’t exactly all that; it may even be more complicated, our feelings difficult to untangle. It’s common that, rather than wanting the partner to choose us, we find ourselves preoccupied with “proof” that the past will not repeat itself, that our beloved will not leave us for someone else.\n\nThe reasons for this are varied, and some or none or all of what I’m about to say will apply to your situation. Take what you like and ignore the rest. But just know that this kind of thing happens more often than is discussed (for obvious reasons).\n\nThere is a safety (i.e., certainty) in becoming involved with someone who is unavailable; we can love while focusing on the wanting, rather than the vulnerability that comes with actual availability. I don’t think we’re to blame entirely; this arrangement usually fits a template of our early experiences where caregivers were sporadically or consistently unavailable. It is absolutely thrilling to be chosen over an “outside” person, in a reversal of what we experienced earlier, where caregivers appeared more interested in things besides us (another child or family, for instance), which of course is a terribly painful abandonment that follows us into adulthood in the form of insecurities, needs, hopes, etc. To be chosen over another appears to be a reversal of abandonment that lands us on solid relational ground at last. We can then finally create or co-create the well-founded home we have dreamed about.\n\nBut how solid is it? After all, we might then ask, “Well, if he or she left his/her spouse before, who’s to say he/she won’t do it again?” Behind or beneath this question are a slew of factors that I think may be worth some serious reflection, either alone, with a trusted friend, or with a counselor. I would suggest doing this before going to your husband to verbalize any concerns.\n\nIt can be disconcerting that certain fears never go away. We learn to live with them, tolerate them, but they can never be banished, especially if we experienced relational traumas early on, such as abandonment, neglect, or abuse. We may have felt unabandoned when he or she chose us, but the underlying fear—because it is rooted in our own histories and psyches—hasn’t been banished, leaving us to wonder if we may, in fact, be abandoned yet again. The “proof” we were seeking is not, it turns out, as iron-clad as we hoped; there are no guarantees he or she won’t leave us for someone else. (There is never such a guarantee, actually.)\n\nThe traumatized, wounded part of ourselves needs to be heard, and this is, in part, a way of announcing itself. The critical voice within may attack us (or our partner) for the “wrongness” of what happened (“how could you be so selfish or reckless,” etc); there may be guilt about how this relationship has come to be, but most often this, too, is connected to the terror of abandonment (i.e., a repetition of actual past abandonment), and our yearnings for connectedness are suddenly subject to self-doubt, and questions arise about whether we’re worthy of happiness. (“You’re not all that; you’re a cheater, too,” and so on.) Of course, certain qualities or behaviors of our partner may stoke these fears, but if we truly, at the core, did not trust this person, we would never have pursued him or her. These fears are spurred for the most part by the historical trauma I’m discussing herein. We may zoom in like a laser on possible “signs” of such abandonment happening and interpret them as such, stoking our anxieties, but the cause of it is usually a terror of yet another experience of being left behind.\n\nIt’s something of a cliché in our pop culture to believe that (as Sting once sang), “if you love someone, set them free.” But the existential truth, I believe, is that we really do have to give our partners the dignity of their choices, and your partner has chosen to be with you now. That same respect is due us, since I believe that the majority of us are not malevolent and are, in the main, doing the best we can. Why not give the relationship a chance? It probably has a better chance if you take the risk of trusting him; otherwise, it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy where fear and anxiety suffocate any chance you might have. We can’t always help who we love; the point is to understand our choices rather than simply give them the thumbs-up or -down. I think the more important question is why we choose who we choose, rather than it being “right or wrong” (which only obscures the deeper issues).\n\nOf course, once you have a clear sense of what those underlying motives are—once you understand what “your side of the street” looks like in terms of facing your inevitable psychological demons—then you might be able to reveal your vulnerabilities to your partner and verbalize what does and doesn’t help you in your personal quest for healing. (For example, “Do you mind telling me where you’re going for the time being? I appreciate you indulging me in this as I work on myself.” As opposed to, “Where are you going? Who are you seeing? What are you up to?”) Our partners can greatly support but cannot replace that healing process. In a way, we need these types of things to show us where the healing needs to occur. The danger is in expecting that a relationship can supplant past injuries. Vulnerability is inevitable."

    "QuestionTitle": "I Can’t Seem to Focus Anymore. Is Something Wrong with Me?",
    "Question": "Hi, I'm hoping you can help me with my situation. I am finding it harder and harder to focus. Whether I am at work, reading, or even talking on the phone or watching TV, my mind frequently wanders to something else and I totally lose track of whatever it was I was supposed to be concentrating on. This happens every day, and it seems to be happening with increasing frequency. Is this possibly due to some mental or brain disorder? I want to get this figured out. I find that too often I have to go back and re-read something I read, rewind the TV, or act like I've been listening and say something nondescript to make it seem like I am engaged. What's wrong with me? Thanks.",
    "TherapistReply": "That sounds very frustrating. It also sounds like it might be causing you some anxiety, which might be perpetuating the attentional issues you are experiencing. Does this ring true? If so, next time you feel this happening you might want to try taking a few deep breaths, direct your focus to your breathing and then gently remind yourself to focus on the task at hand.\n\nI find myself wondering if your mind is often going to the same thing when it wanders. We all go through challenging times in life that can make it difficult to focus on what we are trying to do in the present moment. For example, if you’ve recently experienced the loss of a relationship, you may find your mind wandering to that person, to memories of time spent together, to sadness about an unknown future, to the fear of loneliness.\n\nIf, however, this issue seems to have no connection to a recent loss or transition in your life, I might wonder if you are feeling bored or restless with where you are in your life right now. Sometimes a difficulty focusing can be an indicator that it is time to shake things up a bit.\n\nIt might be helpful to you to partner with a therapist to try to sort through some of these things and see if you can develop an understanding of how this came to be a part of your life. If you do choose to meet with a therapist, it might be a good idea to try to find someone who has some expertise in attentional issues. While it is possible that the issues you are describing are a natural part of some sort of a transition in your life or an indicator that a change is needed, it is also possible that something else is going on. Perhaps there is an undiagnosed attentional issue that could be identified and worked on or treated. A therapist with expertise in attentional issues will be able to help you distinguish between these possibilities and help you move to a place of greater peace and focus.\n\nIf you haven’t done so already, I also recommend seeing a doctor to rule out any possible medical causes."

    "QuestionTitle": "My 7-Year-Old Son Likes Dolls, Dresses, and Make-Up. Help!",
    "Question": "I fear that my 7-year-old son might be gay. I know that it's not politically correct to fear that and that I should support whatever sexual identity he ends up living, and I'm really trying to accept things, as I will love him forever no matter what. He's a great kid. I'm not one of those people who see gay people as less than. But the reality is that where I live here in the rural deep south, he would have a VERY rough go of it both growing up and as a young adult. I want the best life has to offer for my child and I don't want him bullied or exposed to the kind of homophobic hate that is known to run rampant around these parts. Here's why I think he might be gay by the way: He plays mostly with dolls, avoids sports and the types of toys boys tend to go for, is always asking about my make-up, and he even wanted to be Princess Elsa from the movie \"Frozen\" for Halloween this year. I couldn't bring myself to let him and he ended up being Spider-Man. He doesn't understand what the problem is. What am I supposed to do? I feel like a bad parent if I suppress who he wants to be, but I feel like a bad parent if I let him do something that he might grow out of and he gets bullied or emotionally scarred in the meantime.",
    "TherapistReply": "I hear your struggle and pain, and you are not alone. It is so hard to know just what the right thing to do for your kids may be when you see them potentially heading down a road that could make their lives more difficult and quite possibly more dangerous.\n\nThe best thing you can do for your son is offer him unconditional love and support by letting him know that you love him as he is, for who he is, and that nothing can change that. Whether he eventually realizes himself to be a member of the LGBTQIA community or is simply just drawn to more traditionally feminine toys and activities, he is likely to hear about these things from his peers. By trying to protect him from the hate and mockery of others, you may unintentionally give him the message that you don’t think his choices are OK and that he needs to hide who he is. He needs to have a safe place to be himself, and that should be with you. (It should be everywhere, really, but with you is a must.)\n\nThat said, you can also equip him for living in your community. You can give him the tools he needs to combat bullying and hate. At 7, he is probably at least somewhat aware of how others may respond to him. You can talk with him about possible reactions to him choosing an Elsa costume over a Spider-Man costume. Empower him to make choices and prepare him for the ramifications. Let him know that the problem is NOT in his choice, but in the ignorance and bigotry that exist in the world. Help him find allies in the community—friends, teachers, other parents—who support him. Bullying and hate are terrible things, but they can be managed with support. Kids who internalize feelings that who they are is not OK suffer terribly, often feeling shame, isolation, and loneliness. These are the kinds of feelings that lead to hopelessness, depression, and even suicide.\n\nYour question resonates deeply with me. My 4-year-old son is also drawn to dresses and make-up. He loves trucks and dinosaurs, but he chose to be Elsa for Halloween this year (it’s a popular costume!). When he wanted to wear a dress to school last week, I hesitated. When he was 2 or 3 it was no big deal, but lately I’ve seen that his peers respond in less accepting ways to cross-gender preferences. He wore the dress, but we practiced what he might say to friends if they laughed, made fun of him, or called him a girl. The moment we walked into the classroom, a group of boys did exactly that. He responded with, “Nope, I’m a boy. I just wanted to wear this.” And that was the end of it. Granted, at 4 and 5, kids are generally more accepting than at 7, but I hear your fears and your concerns, and all you can do is equip him to handle what he may face—and the best way to do that is by making sure he knows there is nothing wrong with him.\n\nIf I can also offer a little clarification as well: There is a difference between gender preferences, gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Preferring toys and objects that are traditionally associated with a different gender does not necessarily have anything to do with gender identity or sexual orientation. Your son may be more sensitive and nurturing than his male peers. There are girls his age who prefer some of the more traditionally male toys. That does not necessarily mean they are gay or straight or bisexual. Nor does it mean that those girls identify more as masculine or the boys identify more as feminine. Kids like what they like. We are the ones who make meaning of it and attach labels.\n\nIf you need support for yourself or your son in figuring out how to navigate through these issues, find a therapist who works with gender fluidity. Whether or not your son is gay, a therapist trained in LGBTQ+ issues would have a lot of resources and strategies for navigating how to be different in an intolerant community."

    "QuestionTitle": "Is It Possible to Become Dependent on Therapy? I’m Not Rich!",
    "Question": "I feel like I am probably clinically depressed, I've never been diagnosed but I have never gone to see anyone about it, either, so who knows. I just feel blah all the time and unmotivated to do anything. You are probably going to tell me to just go get it checked out, but my fear is that I will end up in therapy and become dependent on it. Is that possible, to become dependent on therapy? I don't want it to be my only way forward. Can I get through this without going to therapy, you think? I hear that certain depression medications can be addictive, too. The last thing I need is to become addicted to medication AND therapy. I'm sure therapists make more money when you have to come back, so where is the incentive to help? I'm not rich.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for the letter and your thoughtful questions. I am very pleased that you reached out, seeking advice on what to do.\n\nYou ask if it’s possible to become dependent on therapy, and as much as I would like to offer a simple answer, the honest answer is much more complex. Many people come to rely on the insight of their therapist and the relationship they foster in the safe confines of the therapy room. However, it is the responsibility of the ethical therapist to create conditions that do not foster or encourage dependence, and to do his or her part in helping a person in therapy learn to function and perhaps even thrive without the therapist.\n\nThe point of therapy is not to keep people in therapy indefinitely; if a person is not getting better or otherwise seeing desired results, the therapist has an ethical obligation to stop working with that person. Therapists are also bound by an ethics code that does not allow them to benefit financially if the person isn’t benefiting therapeutically. Additionally, you are always free to choose when you end therapy, unless you are court ordered to attend. On the other hand, many people maintain a relationship with a therapist long term and go in for “tune-ups” when needed—which, of course, is not the same as being “dependent.”\n\nBeyond any ethical obligations, please know that good therapists thrive off of people getting better. If it was about making money, most therapists would chose a different profession. Most therapists truly care about the well-being of the people they work with. That’s why they do what they do.\n\nAs for medication, yes, some meds can be addictive after long-term use. I am not a psychiatrist, so I can’t speak to which medications specifically. There is certainly a lot of fear about becoming dependent on medication, and I understand that fear. However, if you were to seek out therapy and/or medication, the clinician or physician you work with can discuss with you, at length, which medications might work best without being addictive. Also, you have a say in your treatment, so if you want to change or eliminate medication (should you decide to use it), that is always your choice. It is imperative to remember to only make changes under a doctor’s supervision, however.\n\nYou ask whether you can get better on your own. That is a question I can’t really answer. There are anecdotal accounts of people who defeated depression without the use of therapy and/or medication, but there are a lot more who did it with the assistance of a mental health professional and/or medication. I believe the best and fastest healing of the things that ail us comes through relationships. Research has consistently shown that people who go to therapy and use medication have better and long-term recovery from their mental health/emotional concerns.\n\nI’m curious, though, whether your desire to avoid therapy has less to do with cost and more to do with stigma. There’s nothing wrong or bad about needing therapy; many people do, including therapists themselves. Even just a session or two of therapy often yields insight and healing that can help a person move forward. I challenge you to view the possibility of therapy in such a light.\n\nI suggest that you interview some therapists; ask them about their methods, how they feel about the use of medication, and how long the people they see usually remain in therapy. The foundation of a good therapeutic relationship is trust, and trust is fostered through honest communication. You can begin building that bridge immediately simply by openly expressing your concerns and sharing your fears. You have every right to ask as many questions as you have, and a good therapist will do his or her best to address and alleviate your concerns. Even if you decide ultimately not to pursue therapy, at least you will have explored all your options."

    "QuestionTitle": "Should I Give My Emotionally Abusive Husband Another Chance?",
    "Question": "I filed for divorce several months ago from my husband of almost 16 years. It was a very difficult decision to make; however, I finally believed that he had crossed the line with his verbal and emotional abuse. We have two children and he is a good dad, but I sometimes see the abusive behavior toward the kids as well (NEVER physical). Anyway, from the day he was served with the divorce papers, he has been begging, pleading, crying, etc., for me to cancel the divorce and give him another chance. There has been a lot of emotional manipulation mixed in as well (\"Give it one more try for the kids,\" and, \"How can you just give up on your family?\"). He swears over and over he has changed his ways. He still tells me every day that he loves me, listing things out that he has changed about him. He has always been very controlling, and now he states that I can come and go as I please and that he won't check my phone, track me, etc. I am now allowed to travel again for work. He will have a positive attitude and not run his mouth in public, especially when it comes to the kids. He will get along with my family and stop keeping me from them (he doesn't care for them). The list goes on and on. I tell him repeatedly that he needs to change for him, not me. I know this was abuse, but what I really am seeking is how can I be sure that he cannot change? I am holding strong (with the help of therapy) and continuing with the divorce process, but in the meantime, I have doubts every now and then and that I really should give him another chance. Especially for our kids. No one around me sees that point of view! My therapist, my lawyer, my dad, my friends, etc. Ultimately, I know that I am the one that must make the decision, and even though I feel that it is too late in my heart, I want to make sure that I have exhausted every thought and rationalization about this entire mess to giving it another shot. Please help!",
    "TherapistReply": "You are in a tough spot. You have been married for 16 years, and of course there’s a part of you that would love to see him change and spare all of you the challenges that come with restructuring your family. That makes total sense to me. I can’t tell you what to do, but I think one of the most telling parts of your question is the presence of apparent emotional manipulation in his pleas to give him a second chance. I say “apparent” because, although his pleas feel manipulative to you and might very well be strategic, we have to leave open the possibility that the guilt trips are unintentional manifestations of the pain your husband is experiencing. You would know better than me how authentic those pleas are.\n\nWhatever the case, though, it’s clear that he has some work to do. There are plenty of other signals in your narrative—verbal and emotional abuse, controlling/limiting/tracking behaviors, denying social connections—that should alarm you. Those signals are not consistent with a healthy relationship.\n\nThe way I see it, here are the possible scenarios: he has or has not changed and you do or do not call off the divorce. Best case, he has changed and you call off the divorce and, with the help of a marriage counselor, develop a strong and healthy relationship. Worst case, you call off the divorce and it becomes clear in the following weeks/months/years that he has not changed and he reverts to abusive behaviors.\n\nI can’t tell you the likelihood of either scenario in your specific situation, but in my experience, change like the kind your husband is talking about takes time and committed work. In the meantime, I would be concerned about your well-being and the well-being of your children. His intentions may be to change, but there is significant work to be done to implement those changes consistently. Has he started working with a counselor to address his behaviors? How does he react when you don’t give him answers he likes? Do you feel heard, accepted, and safe? If the answer is not a resounding “yes,” there is still work to be done.\n\nLet’s look at some alternative scenarios. What if you continue with the divorce and he shows he is committed to changing? There is nothing to say you can’t let him back into your life in the future if you trust that his changes are real and you feel safe doing so.\n\nIf you continue with the divorce, however, and the negative behaviors continue or escalate, you will know that you made the right decision. It is not unusual for the angry party to try to place the blame for his or her reaction on the other person; if only you had taken him back, it would be different. Don’t buy into that. Either he will choose to operate in this world in a peaceful, kind manner, or he won’t. If his choice is dependent on getting what he wants, then that change is not likely to last."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Can I Trust after My Girlfriend and Friend Betrayed Me?",
    "Question": "How can I trust again? My longtime girlfriend and I broke up this week and I came to find out that she had been cheating on me with one of my supposed friends. We were all friends and would hang out together sometimes, and sometimes they would hang out without me, usually with my knowledge, and both of them insisted over and over again that it was all as \"just friends.\" When I was feeling unsure at one point, the guy even flat-out said to me, \"I am not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with her.\" Stupidly, I took them at their word. I feel like such an idiot for giving the benefit of doubt. Two people I really trusted lied to me over and over and over, then left me broken and alone. I don't know how I could possibly let someone close to me ever again after this. I feel like I don't even want to try to trust anymore, it's too painful when betrayal inevitably happens.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for writing in. Gosh, I’m sorry you’ve been through such an emotionally brutal experience. I can’t imagine the blow of losing a girlfriend and an allegedly good friend at once, in this manner. It sounds like you had some suspicion that something was amiss, but when you asked your alleged friend directly, he lied.\n\nI would not be surprised if you are experiencing some kind of posttraumatic stress from such an experience. Because relationships are so crucial to our sense of self and security in the world—especially intimate relationships—having our trust and emotional safety shattered in this way would naturally be extremely distressing and perhaps traumatic. Sleep, appetite, and other functionality is sometimes affected. Perhaps your other relationships are being affected, in terms of wondering who you can and can’t trust. Being lied to so baldly would completely scramble trust even in our own perceptions and sense of reality since what happened contradicts so dramatically what we thought we were seeing.\n\nThis may account for the self-blame on evidence in your question, when you “feel like an idiot” for trusting. That harsh self-condemnation is the result, I suspect, of trusting your own self-experience with people close to you—who often serve at least in part as reflections of ourselves, our sense of who we are and what we can have faith in—which, now shattered, leaves you with self-doubt over what you thought you were perceiving.\n\nHowever, you are not responsible for the heinous behavior of these two. Taking you at your word (and I see no reason not to), I see no trace of any reason for them to have treated you so shabbily. I imagine this to be another reason for the self-doubt and self-condemnation you express, because our loved ones are often mirrors for us: when someone we trust and love treats us badly, a possible instinctive reaction is, “What am I, chopped liver?” It sounds like these two colluded in deception and abusive behavior, and of course such betrayal would be intensely injurious to anyone’s self-esteem.\n\nOf course, being a therapist, I am going to suggest therapy in the spirit of seeing this episode as trauma. Often, such experiences will revive historical doubts and losses or previous crises of faith, if we have had other betrayals in the past. I think having a safe place to vent and process all kinds of understandable emotional reactions could be quite healing. Rage, grief, shock, hurt, and fear of future betrayals are but a handful of the normal human reactions you might be having, and the safe space of therapy can provide an outlet. You may need to vent about this over and over for a long time, and this is OK; don’t worry about “boring” the counselor or therapist. These losses take time to process and heal.\n\nYou might also want to look around for support groups, even online. Perhaps there is a group, either locally and in person or online, that offers support for those who have been betrayed in this way.\n\nFinally, I wouldn’t be in a super hurry to start pressuring yourself, or feeling pressure from others, to “forgive and move on.” Forgiveness is a more complicated subject than meets the eye, and often presented in highly idealistic terms. In principle, of course, it is a beautiful thing. But people often rush to forgive others for hurts that aren’t fully understood or acknowledged, even by the injured person; superficial forgiveness may be espoused while hurts and resentments unconsciously simmer and continue to impact the personality—exploding when the person is re-traumatized in parallel ways.\n\nI am not “against” forgiveness, of course, and find it ultimately to be liberating (and probably necessary in the long run). But it is not as neat and tidy as presented on bumper stickers and inspirational Facebook posts. There is a nice saying from Al-Anon: “Acceptance is not approval.” One can accept what has happened, without acting vengefully and in a spirit of moving forward, but there’s something to be said for learning from harmful behaviors (dishonesty, selfishness), remembering so as not to repeat them. Sometimes others show us what not to do.\n\nThanks for writing, and I wish you the best in your journey of healing. I hope you find a girlfriend and friend who treat you with the honesty and integrity you deserve. I suggest you treat yourself as a very good friend who is suffering, which is more consideration than you received, sadly, from the two who betrayed you."

    "QuestionTitle": "Am I Having Flashbacks of Childhood Sexual Abuse?",
    "Question": "Recently, I was on vacation visiting some family with young children. As I played with them with their dolls, I had a sort of epiphany, I guess you could call it, of myself playing with dolls when I was a young child. I remembered one instance clearly, where I had my Barbie go into the \"bathroom,\" and my Ken doll would follow her and violently rape her. I remember everything vividly, but why haven't I remembered it earlier, or have I just always known it? Later on that same week, I had a vivid dream of myself as a toddler in the back of someone's car with another small child. I had no shirt on and was being made to touch the other child. The adult was taking pictures the whole time. Child pornography. I have had this dream incredibly often since then and it is unnerving me. Is there some way that I have blocked some form of child abuse from my mind, or did I just overhear something about rape on TV or from my parents? Why did I have this \"fascination\" with rape at such a young age? Could this have anything to do with why I have been drawn to abusive relationships in my older years? Thank you so much for your help and reply.",
    "TherapistReply": "It can be hard to know for certain whether what you have been experiencing is, in fact, a series of previously repressed memories or something else. It is very possible to rediscover memories that have been tucked away and buried for years and not just traumatic ones. Sometimes a smell, a sound, a place, or an experience brings something back to us in vivid detail that had previously been hidden. Sometimes we just get a glimpse of it, an impression, but the effect can be quite unsettling and even disturbing.\n\nI have had the experience of suddenly recalling an event from decades earlier with vivid detail. I had to call a family member to confirm if what I was remembering was accurate (it was). My event was not traumatic or upsetting; I was far more troubled by the fact of its absence than by its reappearance.\n\nIt is possible that your memory, triggered by your experience with your friends’ children, is accurate. You may be remembering an event or an amalgamation of a series of events. It is not unusual for children to engage in play with dolls that explores sexual themes. What seems troubling is the violent nature of the play you are describing. Perhaps you were acting out something you witnessed or heard about. My hope would be that, if you had experienced something so violent in your childhood, someone in your family would have known or been aware that something had happened. Is there anyone you can check in with who might know if what you are remembering happened or who can lend insight?\n\nIn regards to your dream about possible child pornography, our dreams are often a way of processing information that we aren’t able to make meaning of during our waking hours. Your dream may be connected to an experience you had, but it may also be something else. If your dreams and memories are causing you distress, which it sounds as if they are, I strongly urge you to connect with a licensed professional to explore what may be at the root of this and how to reduce your distress in the present.\n\nThe second part of your question, however, brings up another set of concerns. You mention being drawn to abusive relationships in your older years. No matter the reasons or the root causes, this is something I strongly encourage you to get support with. If you find yourself in an unhealthy relationship or unhealthy patterns of relationships, there are steps you can take to change that. A history of abuse in childhood can contribute to adult relationship patterns, but that history doesn’t limit or determine the kinds of relationships we are capable of having."

    "QuestionTitle": "My Wife Wants an Open Marriage. I Don’t. Now What?",
    "Question": "After 17 years of marriage (no kids), my wife told me she would like to open our marriage. This would mean allowing each other to sleep with other people. She says she has been doing a lot of reading about it and has a work friend who is in an open relationship and it works for her. I am outraged by the suggestion as I feel it is a major threat to our marriage. I love and value my wife way too much to allow her to have sex with other men. I know that I would be extremely jealous and could not handle it. She says it would be \"just sex,\" we would make the rules in advance, no feelings involved. It sounds so simple but I am not sure that is how it works. My wife says she has thought about it a lot and she thinks she could handle me having intimate relations with another woman. She says the way she would approach it is with total honesty and communication to make sure everyone feels OK about it. She says that either one of us would have veto power. I don't want to sleep with other women, believe it or not. I don't want to have to wield veto power! I just don't get why she feels like she wants to do this. She says the idea would be to just \"spice things up\" and \"keep things fresh\" and that she thinks it could ultimately bring us closer together. We have a great sex life, which I think she would agree with. I'm so bewildered by this. I feel like my options are: (1) refuse to play along and hope she can respect that and stay happy and faithful; (2) pursue a divorce; (3) allow her to play outside the marriage while I stay true; or (4) both of us try it and hope for the best. Is couples therapy another option? I think I would find it humiliating to tell another person about this, and it might not even help anyway.",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your question. I can only imagine your bewilderment and confusion; things are humming along fine and suddenly, out of nowhere, your wife is asking you to play the “keys in the bowl” game from the 1970s. It sounds like you have a strong marital connection and are completely taken aback by the question, which is understandable. I would feel the same in your shoes.\n\nHere is the key quote, far as I’m concerned: “She says it would be ‘just sex,’ we would make the rules in advance, no feelings involved. It sounds so simple but I am not sure that is how it works.” Frankly, I’m not sure that it works, period. To my mind there is no such thing as “just sex.” We westernized, Cartesian types seem to think we can neatly separate mind and body, but this is a conceptual fantasy that I think has to be done away with. Emotion is irreversibly intertwined with every facet of our being. Even being extremely intellectual has emotional overtones; lack of emotion (coldness, sternness, etc.) is itself an emotion or affect, as we say in psychology. This “no feelings involved” doesn’t make sense because clearly your wife is expressing some desire (i.e., a feeling) for a new sexual experience. The question is, why?\n\nBecause of the intensely physical nature of sex, we tend to think of it as outside the spectrum of the day-to-day relationship—its own special category. I find, though, that the couples who relate together mate together. Sex is on a continuum that includes the mundane interactions of paying bills, housework, schedules, and so on. It puts too much pressure on a couple to have a somewhat routine existence drained of spontaneity and playfulness and then expect sparks in the bedroom. My hunch—from a distance, of course—is that your wife feels something is missing and wants to go outside the relationship to find it. Why is that? What is she not finding between the two of you that she needs to take such an emotional risk of bringing another partner into it? And it is a risk, no matter what anyone says. Sex involves desires that are unconscious, and the latter is always a wild card (which is part of sexuality’s exciting appeal). Of course, my attitude would be different if you were in favor, but you’re obviously strongly opposed.\n\nAre there ways in which she can express some of those desires with you? Is she afraid of hurting your feelings by not saying something or making a request for something new? Is this request for openness a round-about way of expressing dissatisfaction? Are there ways you two can “shake things up” a bit in the romance and sex department? A weekend away, a dance class, a vacation, a little role play? Is there a part of her she wants to let out but is afraid? (Not to be cynical, but I almost wondered when I read your letter if she already had someone in mind.)\n\nYou might want to have a serious talk with your wife or even seek some couples counseling to help her understand how unhappy this idea is making you, and how rattled and bewildered you are in light of it. I think you owe it to yourself, and the marriage, to do all you can to try and seek together, rather than separately, a solution or compromise that allows you both to find satisfaction; you have that rare successful marriage that has endured for many years, and that is definitely worth protecting. It would be tragic for it to slip away due to lack of understanding or withheld feelings or desires. Thanks again for writing."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! I’m in Love with My Best Friend’s Ex!",
    "Question": "I don't know what to do. I have fallen in love with my best friend's ex. My best friend and I have been besties since the fourth grade. We are in our senior year of college now. She was with this guy for four years, up until early May of this year, when he suddenly decided to break up with her. He said he just didn't see a future together. I started hanging out with him about two weeks later, at first thinking I was just being someone to talk to. But I never told my bestie that we were spending time together, let alone that we were growing close. Well, me and this guy started sleeping together about two weeks ago and we're crazy about each other. I still haven't told my best friend anything. My feeling is that she would be very hurt, but at the same time I don't want to pass up a chance to be with someone who could turn out to be the love of my life, you know? So a part of me wants to tell her in the hopes that she would be happy for me, but when I put myself in her shoes hearing this news, I think I'd be devastated. I'm torn between my own desire for lasting relationship bliss and my desire to preserve the most important friendship in my life. Any advice for me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Your friend is going to be hurt. There is no way around that. When you made the choice to start hanging out with your best friend’s ex without telling her, that’s when you made the decision to hide your actions, and possibly your feelings, from her. On some level you must have known that she would be bothered by it, and you chose not to tell her. I don’t say this to judge or to blame, but I think it is important to be clear about what has been happening.\n\nShe will very likely be devastated and feel betrayed by her best friend and by the man she thought she had a lasting future with. I wish I could tell you otherwise, but I think you already know this.\n\nIn some ways, you’ve already made your choice. You feel this man could be the love of your life, and you’ve chosen to begin a relationship with him. I think what you are looking for is a way to share this with your friend without losing her friendship. That may not be possible. I think you are also hoping to alleviate some guilt you may be feeling about hurting someone you care deeply about. You can spend time and mental energy finding all kinds of justifications for your choices, but that’s not going to be helpful, ultimately.\n\nYou believe this relationship could be serious and real, so why not stop hiding? Own up to your feelings. You can’t expect your friend to be happy for you, not right away, at least, and perhaps not ever. What you can do is honor your long-standing friendship by being honest with her about what is happening, and own the fact you know you have hurt her. Let her know you are sorry she is hurting, and allow her to react however she chooses to. She is entitled to be angry, hurt, and sad. I think you show wisdom in recognizing how you would feel were the situation reversed. Keep that in mind when you talk with her.\n\nYour friend may have a hard time being around you or seeing the two of you together. That is understandable. Mutual friends may weigh in on both sides of the issue. There will be no shortage of people with opinions and judgment. She, or others, may try to make you feel guilty or ashamed of what has happened. You do not have to accept those feelings. Is it unfortunate that you have fallen for your friend’s ex? Yes. Would it have been better to talk with her before things got to this point? Sure. However, all you can do now is own your choices and move forward with honesty and integrity.\n\nYou also have the opportunity to use this experience as a chance for some introspection. Most of us have beliefs about ourselves and how we would react in hypothetical situations. I imagine you once thought that you would never choose a guy over a friendship. Those beliefs get put to the test when we are confronted with real-world feelings and experiences. When confronted by real and conflicting feelings, you chose the potential of a serious romantic relationship over your friendship. This may have been a really wise choice or a poor choice. Only time will tell if this choice was worth it. Understanding what led you to make the choice, and finding some peace around your decision, will be important for you. If you find you are struggling with feelings of guilt or sadness in the aftermath of your talk with your friend, I encourage you to seek out support from a counseling professional.\n\nI will add one more word of caution. Consider how much you can and should trust a man who would break up with someone so abruptly after four years and within two weeks seek solace from her best friend. I am not saying that what you have isn’t real, but might you find yourself in a similar situation four years from now? I imagine your friend thought their love was the real thing, too. You are sacrificing a long-lasting friendship for an uncertain future. Make sure your confidence is not misplaced."

    "QuestionTitle": "If My Wife Won’t Lose Weight, Am I Justified in Leaving Her?",
    "Question": "I feel incredibly guilty for even writing this, but I am at a loss and I need your help. My wife and I have been married for six years, and I love her with all my heart, but in those six years she has completely let herself go, to the point I no longer feel attracted to her and I have serious doubts about whether she will live long enough to grow old with me. When we met eight years ago, I was about 170 pounds and she was about 160. Today I am 190 and she is 380. She doesn't work. She doesn't exercise. She won't eat healthy, at least not consistently. Her doctor told her she needs to do something, she can't keep going like this, and yet she still refuses to change, knowing her life is getting shorter because of it. Maybe she is depressed, I know that I am. But I am at the end of my rope. This is not the woman I married. If she refuses to take care of herself, do I have a right to feel inclined to leave her? I am really struggling with this.",
    "TherapistReply": "I really appreciate the authenticity with which you present your situation. The guilt you are feeling for writing in—and even for having the thoughts feelings you have—is palpable.\n\nIt is clear how much you love and care for your wife. You express concern about her physical and mental health and feel fearful that she will not survive long enough to grow old with you. This suggests that you want her to be around to grow old with and you know she needs to be healthier, both physically and emotionally, in order for that to happen. That said, you can’t control your wife’s choices and behaviors; you can only control your own choices and behaviors. In that vein, I think it could be helpful for you to consider engaging in your own therapy. You are dealing with fear, shame, guilt, and anxiety about the uncertainty of your marriage. This is a lot to carry around. Therapy can provide a safe place and a strong therapeutic relationship to support you as you sort through these issues.\n\nFrom your description, it does sound entirely possible that your wife could be depressed. She may also benefit from therapy. Again, you can’t control whether she goes to therapy, but you can encourage her to consider it and ask her to do it. If you do decide to enter therapy and you share the benefits of your therapeutic experience with her, she might feel the inspiration and motivation to get started herself. If she doesn’t feel ready for her own individual therapy, maybe she would be willing to go to couples therapy with you or even just come to some sessions with you and your therapist.\n\nOf course, it’s possible your wife won’t change, or even attempt to. It’s understandable that, if this plays out, you may consider walking away from the marriage. It’s also understandable if you decide to stay, in spite of your concerns, because of how you feel about your wife. There’s not really a wrong answer here.\n\nI guess the bottom line is this: You both seem to be hurting, and it seems to be damaging your marriage, but there also seems to be a lot of love here. If you can each make a commitment to working through this to get to a healthier place, you’ll be off to pretty strong start."

    "QuestionTitle": "Help! My Wife Is Spending Us into Bankruptcy",
    "Question": "When is enough enough already? My stay-at-home wife of almost two years isn't staying at home enough for my tastes. Instead she's out spending every last dollar we have and then some. We have credit card bills out the wazoo from her many unnecessary and luxurious shopping sprees. She's even buying expensive purses and meals for her leech girlfriends! I have told her that she can't keep spending like this or we're going to lose everything. She says it's fine and she has it under control and we can pay off the credit card bills over time. Well, it's going to be a lot of time, and that's if she stops today. I'm not OK with this irresponsible approach to our finances, but I don't know what can be done. She just keeps spending and spending, ignoring my pleas for restraint. What savings we had are gone. I feel like my options are to stick it out with this woman and go bankrupt and have our home foreclosed on, or to divorce her, in which case she'll get half of everything I own plus spousal support. She won't acknowledge that there is a problem, so it would be impossible to get her to seek help for something she doesn't see as a problem. What would you do if you were me?",
    "TherapistReply": "Thanks for your question. Boy, that is a doozy of a choice: bankruptcy or divorce. Would you rather lose the arm or the leg? It really does sound like your wife has a shopping addiction or compulsion that needs addressing sooner rather than later. As an addiction specialist, here are the (somewhat unsavory) choices I see you facing. The crux of it is this: get help … for both you and your wife. You are in a seriously traumatic situation, facing several imminent losses, and I would therefore suggest you:\n\nFind a couples counselor with experience in addiction. To make sure the counselor has this experience, ask him or her to give you a treatment plan for a couple where one is addicted. A good counselor will ask both parties to get help; a competent counselor understands that addiction (or destructive compulsion such as constant overspending) is a family issue. You are experiencing the trauma of facing bankruptcy and/or the loss of your partner, which is frightening to say the least (and probably causes strong resentments and/or fears, which is but one reason support for you is crucial). An inexperienced counselor will say, “Welp, not much you can do except get a divorce lawyer or cut up the credit cards.” You might want to consult with a divorce attorney, just for information’s sake—like tips on how to protect yourself financially—but I honestly don’t think that’s the most important thing initially. I think the most important thing is that you realize your wife has something akin to an addiction (or manic behavior, which often involves highly compulsive behaviors)—and that you take care of yourself, to ensure you make the calmest, most reasonable decisions possible. Even if she doesn’t agree to the couples counseling, I suggest you …\nGet yourself a therapist who understands addictions, for an outlet to vent, complain, cry, whatever … so that you can find some calm and at least passing serenity, to listen to what your heart and intuition are telling you. Otherwise, you will be acting out of reactivity and rage (or terror) and may make rash decisions you regret. Your wife needs help, and for your own conscience’s sake, you probably want to at least give her the opportunity to get help. You can search GoodTherapy.org for couples counselors and individual therapists.\nAttend a few Al-Anon meetings. Now, Al-Anon technically is for people who have a friend or family member “whose drinking or sobriety is bothering” the attendee. However, people in Al-Anon usually have very good experience with boundaries, and setting boundaries with compassion and detachment rather than a flamethrower. (Rage and resentment are completely understandable reactions, of course; it’s the decisions and actions taken I’m focusing on here.) You can share at the meeting in a general way about “my wife’s addiction” or talk to people afterward; I’d be surprised if at least a handful didn’t offer some practical, experienced suggestions.\nI would also look into a recovery program designed for precisely the issue you and your wife face: compulsive debting. Debtors Anonymous was created to help those who behave exactly like your wife. Here is their website, in case you want to go to a meeting to talk to some members for guidance or get some literature. You can, of course, mention this program to your wife, but I’d suggest you either go with her or go on your own to find out about one possible approach to treating this compulsive “debting.”\nYou may decide these meetings are not right for you or your situation in the long run, but if you try and listen with an open mind, you will hopefully discover you’re not alone in this, and many individuals and couples have recovered from a seemingly hopeless situation.\n\nWhich brings me to the emotional side of this. After you’ve tried some or all of the above, you’ll want to sit down with your wife and say, in as caring a way as possible, you are very concerned and would like her to get help (as in couples counseling or individual therapy). If she refuses, you may bring up the other tough choices you’re looking at. The point is, the current situation is intolerable, and you’re taking action and suggest she does the same. (This way you’re both doing something, and she’s “following along” rather than being shamed or cajoled into anything.) In other words, you feel you both need to do something different or you’re both heading for the poorhouse. You can stress how much this is hurting you. (Use “I feel” rather than “you” statements; as in “I feel terrified,” “I feel hurt” by her unwillingness to stop, etc.) This is harder than it sounds, which is why the support for you is so crucial. Your wife may need your help if she first refuses help then later “hits bottom” in realizing she is in fact drowning.\n\nYou may be thinking “why is she doing this to me,” but that might not be necessarily the case, or the whole of it. She may need treatment for mania, or is avoiding some kind of trauma, or is somehow addicted to the powerful “high” of shopping (much more common in our hyper-materialist culture than people realize). But my bottom line for you, since you have so wisely reached out for help, is to stabilize and soothe yourself in the midst of this traumatic chaos, and then have the conversation with her or begin contemplating the hard decisions.\n\nIf you want more information or consultation, feel free to contact me. Thanks again for writing. I hope your wife agrees to get the help she needs."

    "QuestionTitle": "How Serious Is Paranoia? Am I Crazy? Do I Need Meds?",
    "Question": "I'm paranoid. Does this mean I'm mentally ill? I'm 33 and this started about three years ago. I started seeing shapes in shadows and people following me. It took me like a year to know that real people might not be following me after I talked to multiple friends about it. They all said I was paranoid and wrong. But I still see them following me and sometimes they are listening. My family says I am safe and I believe them, but then I don't know always and I'm scared I'm crazy. Am I mental? Do I need meds?",
    "TherapistReply": "Having paranoid thoughts does not mean you are crazy. Some people have these thoughts as a result of feeling anxious or stressed. So you have company; other people have feelings like these too. Nevertheless, paranoid feelings are tough to live with and there are ways to help.\n\nFirst off, you have support from your community. You are lucky that people are standing behind you. I see from your letter that your friends are trying to be helpful and reassuring, and that your family tells you that you are safe. Even though you believe them on the one hand, on the other hand you’re not always sure that they should be believed and you’re still scared. Your folks are telling you that “everything is OK,” but that doesn’t necessarily make it so. People want to make things OK for their loved ones, but reassurance often doesn’t work. It’s like someone is telling you there are no monsters, when they don’t believe in monsters but you do and you know better than they do. What they have to say may not be entirely credible to you, just as you are not entirely credible to them. You might let them know that you are grateful that they want to help, but that telling you everything is OK actually doesn’t work that well. If they truly want to help, they can start by believing that you are having upsetting experiences and that things are not at all OK, as far as you’re concerned. The top way for them to help would be to encourage you to get medical advice, perhaps by accompanying you to the doctor.\n\nThe best course of action is for you to get checked out by a medical doctor who will give you a thorough physical examination to determine if, for example, you have high blood pressure, which can cause many different types of unpleasant thoughts and feelings, as can various types of seizure disorders. Certain substances and recreational drugs can also cause feelings of intense fear and suspicion, so if you do use marijuana, hash, meth, LSD, cocaine, alcohol to excess, etc., be aware that this is a possible side effect of drug use and tell your doctor.\n\nYou write that these experiences first began about three years ago, and I wonder if you associate this time to any other events in your life. This is a question that your doctor should ask you. You should be completely open and frank in all your responses to help find out what is going on.\n\nPerhaps your doctor will refer you to someone who specializes in understanding experiences such as yours; that person might determine if you in fact are having paranoid thoughts, and what you might do next. A psychiatrist, if you decide to see one, might prescribe a medication that will help control your anxiety, and/or you might be referred to a psychologist or mental health counselor who will engage in talk therapy with you. The therapist will try to understand the meanings of your experiences.\n\nOften people are frightened of seeing a practitioner who specializes in these kinds of issues, perhaps because of feelings of shame or because they don’t really know what happens in a psychiatrist’s or psychologist’s office. Some folks are afraid that if they are prescribed medication, the medicine will somehow make them different in a way that they don’t want, as though the medicine will take them over, as they also fear the doctor might. People are afraid of losing control, or a sense of themselves.\n\nThere is a lot of prejudice and misinformation about emotional issues—we tend to see things as though we are living in a movie, maybe a scary one, but not trying to find out what is going on with oneself is much scarier. Please see a doctor and let me know what happens.\n\nHere are some things people sometimes fear about psychiatry:\n\nThey will think I am “crazy” and lock me up.\nThey will give me medicine that will make me a zombie.\nThey will take control of my life.\nPeople will find out and look down on me.\nIt will affect my work life.\nIt will affect my love life.\nMovies and video games make this whole subject really scary.\nPeople are scared because they don’t know what actually happens in a doctor’s office. In fact, first you will see your regular doctor who will give you a thorough physical checkup. If the doctor decides it is warranted, you will be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist or mental health worker. The psychiatrist might prescribe medication. The psychologist or mental health worker will talk with you, and then, working together with you, try to find out the meanings behind your fears and what to do about them."
